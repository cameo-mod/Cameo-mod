WARN raw 231/322; (cross-check audit_weapon_shape W5)
Lower `RAW_SPLIT_BASELINE` as weapons are collapsed; never raise it. W5 also resolves inheritance, but includes zero/healing/ally-only flat nodes and has narrower type/name rules. Use audit_weapon_shape.py --compare-split for the exact set difference; neither count is subtracted or reclassified.
