# audit_bot_direct_mutation

Scanned 185 bot-module source files for direct actor `CancelActivity`/`QueueActivity`/`SetStance` calls.

PASS — zero direct-activity sites. Bots drive actors exclusively through the order stream; multiplayer stays in sync and the order gate (§19.6) sees every issuer/lease pairing.
