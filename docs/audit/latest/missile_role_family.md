| code | check | count | ratchet |  |
|---|---|---|---|---|

These selectors need recipient-type evidence; they are not certified conforming.


## payload blends - counted, never failed

| family | weapons |
|---|---|
| MissileChem | 16 |
| MissileCryo | 6 |
| MissileFire | 7 |
| MissileQuantum | 4 |
| MissileSonic | 2 |
| MissileTesla | 13 |
| MissileThermobaric | 1 |


The ruling covers the three ROLE families only. A blend carries a
payload identity (chem, cryo, nuke) that outranks the role tag.


## Supplemental exact owner-wrapper equivalence — not the raw gate

Groups only enumerated one-parent wrappers whose current ordered payload equals the retained parent. Every concrete finding remains in the raw counts and exit gate above; equivalent payload does not make its role correct.

| code | raw findings | exact-equivalence groups |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | 15 | 15 |
| R2 | 8 | 8 |
| R3 | 4 | 4 |
| R4 | 4 | 4 |
