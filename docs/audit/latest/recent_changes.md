## Reviewer checklist (not machine-checkable)

- [ ] Every yaml change in the window boot-gated (`launch-game.cmd` reached the menu)?
- [ ] C# changes rebuilt (`dotnet build -c Release -p:TargetPlatform=win-x64`)?
- [ ] New actors/weapons named with underscores only, and Fluent keys added?
- [ ] Generated reports under `docs/audit/latest/` regenerated via run_all.sh, not hand-edited?
- [ ] ROADMAP.md updated for finished/queued work?
