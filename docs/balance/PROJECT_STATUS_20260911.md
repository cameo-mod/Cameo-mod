# Four-faction balance project — current status, 11 September 2026

**Current control state: implementation is continuing on GPT-5.6 Luna Max after
the Astra review.** The continuation review corrected Sol's Havoc regression and
several report/helper errors. Scheduled Discord monitoring is **ACTIVE** with a
15-minute cadence and a saved expiration of 14 September 2026 at 00:16:58 WIB.

The reviewed execution plan is [GRAND_PLAN_20260911.md](GRAND_PLAN_20260911.md).
The active model is **GPT-5.6 Luna Max**. Astra High provides occasional
read-only milestone review; DeepSeek remains excluded. The scoped continuation
and milestone-only native Discord replies have already been published. Merge,
game launch, engine build and external coordination setup remain unauthorized.

## Planning review — current conclusions

- The balanced four-faction candidate is incomplete. The earlier diagnostic-only
  "50%" milestone is withdrawn as an overall progress measure. A narrower
  bug-finding test cannot silently replace the requested candidate.
- Keep previously applied targeting, outgoing-firepower and cargo-cost work;
  the detailed checkpoints below are evidence, not instructions to replay them.
- The 163-row matrix now matches the current active candidate actor set exactly,
  after explicitly excluding three superweapons. All **71 archived ledger inputs
  are available and match** the permanent baseline hashes. Original per-armor
  channels are still unverified: those inputs do not retain all target/Versus
  fields. The old actor snapshot must not be edited to add the new binding field
  Sol demanded. A separate reviewed reconstruction contract can link the original
  snapshot and reconstructed channel dataset. The current 29 groups stay withheld.
- **GP-01 promotion evidence repair is complete locally.** The corrected
  discount receipt resolves the active buff and reports an 11.4% formula-only
  context without using it as the 1500/tier rationale. The replacement audit
  has 23 explicit pairs, excludes three additional shared-token options, binds
  each weapon's identity and metrics to one offensive record, and applies no
  global strict-superiority gate. The interaction inventory excludes numeric
  literals and retains 16 individually unresolved condition names. Existing
  pre-GP-01 receipts remain historical; use the successor receipts linked below.
- Sol's GP-03 completion claim is withdrawn. Its Havoc change removed real
  existing Air damage, so that change has been reversed exactly. Rapier's AP
  correction remains and now has synchronized raw/derived ledgers. There are
  19 candidate target-route review rows; custom tags and secondary damage are
  not certified by the absence of a simple domain-mismatch flag.
- A class fit uses every contributor. A DPS-basis mismatch now holds all rows
  using that fitted class, correcting the previous row-only check. The 31-row
  proposal therefore has **13 reviewable rows and 18 held rows**, all unapproved.
- **GP-02 admission hardening is complete locally.** The reconstruction contract
  now requires a versioned, hash-checked JSON receipt under an explicit portable
  root, exact frozen-baseline and selected-dataset identities, reviewed scope,
  method, normalization, source SHA-256 provenance and reconciled source-state
  fields. Missing, stale, malformed, path-escaping, non-integer-schema,
  string-only and contradictory source-state evidence fail closed. This validates
  the evidence contract; it does not rederive historical armor channels.
  The 29 armor groups remain withheld.
- The [complete proposal table](../audit/latest/astra_review_20260911/candidate_proposals.md)
  now includes **all 163 active candidate actors**, with current HP/speed/cost,
  available numerical proposals and each remaining pricing rule or decision.
  It distinguishes 26 air/naval class-design rows, 12 static defenses, six
  economy units and one missing-class case instead of calling all 45 generic
  class gaps. Support, transports, garrisons and limited units retain their
  separate rules. Listing every actor does not certify every price.
- Aedis accepted the **1500 virtual credits per promotion tier pilot** in his
  native Reply at 17:32. That direction is recorded; it does not resolve the
  inaccurate supporting rationale, exact affected actor set, or publication
  boundary. The 20:01 DM requests a duplicate-free Claude continuation; Blackrobe's
  20:11 messages reaffirm no setup outside Cameo. The plan provides a passive
  repository handoff, with no agent connection or infrastructure.

## Current task ownership

Keep this table as the only live ownership record for the scoped plan. CL-01 was
reserved for Aedis's Claude and is now complete in PR #346; Codex reviews that
report without duplicating its analysis. All implementation remains with Codex;
an empty owner does not authorize automatic claims on overlapping files.

| Task | Owner | State | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plan and documentation review | Codex parent | Corrected; included in this continuation | Keep this plan as the execution authority |
| GP-01 promotion evidence repair | Codex / GPT-6 Astra | **Corrected; included in this continuation** | Use the promotion receipts in `astra_review_20260911`; armor labels describe identity, conditions retain case, and unknown/cyclic tiers stay unresolved |
| GP-02 source and channel evidence | Codex / GPT-5.6 Luna Max | **PARTIAL** — roster reconciled; 71/71 frozen ledger inputs recovered; reconstruction admission contract hardened | Supply independently reviewed reconstruction evidence before admitting channel votes; original scalar baseline remains intact |
| GP-03 role and payload closure | Codex implementation; Claude CL-01 analysis | **PARTIAL** — Rapier reviewed; Havoc regression reversed; CL-01 report complete | Review PR #346's findings; the shared PDLaser payload-mask correction is now applied; keep V2's existing surface role pending a design call |
| CL-01 target/payload review | Aedis's Claude | **COMPLETE in open PR #346** — 19 rows dispositioned | Codex reviews `db102bb16`; no duplicate edits to the report |
| GP-04 per-unit proposals | Codex / GPT-5.6 Luna Max | **Full 163-actor table; numerical pricing still partial** | Use `astra_review_20260911/candidate_proposals.md`: 13 reviewable and 18 held numerical proposals, with explicit routes for the other 132 actors |
| GP-05 promotion and cargo batch | Codex / GPT-5.6 Luna Max | **Non-live helper corrected; content pending final prices** | Preserve atomic promotion removal/price compensation; do not treat the helper as applied gameplay |
| GP-06 application and GP-07 playtest | Codex; maintainer playtest | Later milestones | Follow specific content and runtime authorization |
| GP-08 portable handoff and checkpoint | Codex / GPT-6 Astra | Authorized publication batch | Publish to Blackrobe's fork and link a draft continuation to #342; retain merge hold |
| Aedis DM heartbeat | Codex heartbeat | **ACTIVE**; 15-minute cadence; saved expiration 2026-09-14 00:16:58 WIB | Use a new temporary external-browser tab for every check; preserve native Reply, `[Codex]` and milestone-only communication |

## Intended milestone

Deliver a reviewable TD GDI/Nod and RA1 Allies/Soviets candidate under the agreed
rules: correct role/targeting behavior, documented source comparisons, coherent
pricing and disposition of meaningful calibration issues. Complete combined
per-source armor curves, percentage/target-state treatment and projectile
comparisons remain requested work. A narrow bug-finding session is not silently
substituted for the intended balanced candidate. Runtime/playtest approval is a
separate outstanding requirement; current evidence is static.

## Preservation and working location

Worktree: `C:\Users\Blackrobe\repo\Cameo-mod-worktrees\overnight-integration-20260910`.
Branch: `codex/overnight-integration-20260910`.
The earlier [PR #342](https://github.com/cameo-mod/Cameo-mod/pull/342) was verified
open/draft at `33a2fb2e83645f18910b8155de599e5544c08ee9`. Its head branch belongs to
the upstream organization. Our push destination is Blackrobe's fork, so this
continuation is a linked draft from
[`Blackrobe/Cameo-mod:codex/overnight-integration-20260910`](https://github.com/Blackrobe/Cameo-mod/tree/codex/overnight-integration-20260910).
The new draft is an aggregate preservation checkpoint that includes #342's
history. PRs #339–342 overlap it; none is merge-approved and they must not all be
merged blindly. Original baselines and the old checkpoint manifest are unchanged.
The GP-02 contract-hardening, support-armament pricing, PDLaser payload,
reference-map tooling and built-state condition-selector corrections are
committed through `7ac6b7395` (latest reviewed batch), pushed to Blackrobe's fork and
included in [draft PR #345](https://github.com/cameo-mod/Cameo-mod/pull/345).

From an existing Cameo clone, use a new worktree to preserve your own edits:

```powershell
git fetch https://github.com/Blackrobe/Cameo-mod.git refs/heads/codex/overnight-integration-20260910
git worktree add -b codex/claude-target-review-20260911 ../cameo-claude-target-review-20260911 FETCH_HEAD
git -C ../cameo-claude-target-review-20260911 rev-parse HEAD
```

Record that full SHA in Claude's report and compare it with the pinned SHA in
the handoff reply/PR description. If the named local branch already exists, use
the existing task worktree after checking its base; do not reset it.
The current status, grand plan, implementation, tests and receipts travel together.
The [portable input packet](checkpoints/20260911/claude-continuation/README.md)
contains the exact four external comparison inputs and 71 archived ledger inputs.
Old absolute Windows paths in receipts record their original generation location;
they are not required directories on Claude's PC. Historical report iterations
are retained for provenance; the successor links below identify current evidence.

## CL-01 — bounded review for Aedis's Claude

**Objective:** determine the real target/payload behavior of the 19 remaining
four-faction rows and return actionable findings without changing gameplay.

**Read first:** this status, the grand plan's GP-03 and role decisions, and
[role/payload disposition](FOUR_FACTION_ROLE_PAYLOAD_DISPOSITION_20260911.md).
Use [target routes](../audit/latest/astra_review_20260911/target_routes.json),
[secondary routes](../audit/latest/secondary_payload_routes_20260911.json), and
[shrapnel scenarios](../audit/latest/shrapnel_scenario_20260911.json) as navigation
aids; resolved active YAML and engine semantics determine actual behavior.
Inspect `mods/cameo/mod.yaml` first and follow its active include lists.

**Current disposition:** complete in Aedis Claude's [PR #346](https://github.com/cameo-mod/Cameo-mod/pull/346)
at `db102bb16`; the scope and write boundary below are the preserved assignment
record, and Codex's review/integration follows it.

**Exact row scope:** zero-based `candidates` indices in the target-route receipt:
`76, 77, 78, 101, 102, 103, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224`.
These are the 19 rows with an actor binding beginning `ra1_allies_`,
`ra1_soviets_`, `td_gdi_` or `td_nod_`. Preserve each root/weapon/warhead identity
in the report; aliases and repeated armament bindings are not extra findings.

**Write scope:** only
`docs/audit/latest/claude_target_payload_review_20260911.md`.
Read affected YAML, templates and source code as needed. Do not edit gameplay,
helpers, baselines, prices or the shared status file. No broad faction audit,
new framework, external service, engine build, game launch, `--check-yaml`, merge
or automatic claim of another task. Publication of Claude's report follows
Aedis/Blackrobe's instructions in Claude's own session, not old fleet orders.

**Completion criteria:** record the base commit; give each of the 19 rows a
disposition (`retain`, `correctness fix proposed`, or `design decision needed`),
source/trait references, relevant target tags and the concrete player impact.
Separate utility interception, recipient-filtered integrity effects, Havoc's
existing Air payload and the Stealth Tank's spawned `CHFlame` damage route.
For a proposed fix, identify every affected consumer and the smallest change;
for a policy choice, give alternatives and a recommendation. A static review
must not claim gameplay proof. Do not nerf Havoc or add Air to the V2 to clear
a domain-only warning. Reuse successful checks; run a focused check only when
needed to resolve an actual uncertainty. Return one report for Codex review.

## Current completed work and evidence

### Aedis Claude CL-01 review — open PR #346

Aedis's Claude completed the reserved one-file review at commit `db102bb16` in
[PR #346](https://github.com/cameo-mod/Cameo-mod/pull/346), with 16 rows retained,
three correctness-fix proposals and two policy decisions. Its mask analysis
confirms that most warnings are actor-type recipient filters rather than domain
exclusions. The shared `PDLaser` payload-mask correction is now applied in this
branch; `PointDefenseTesla` already carried the corresponding projectile mask.
The engine's `IPointDefense.Destroy` interception path is independent of
warhead damage, so this static correction does not claim runtime interception
proof. The flying-infantry target-type behavior and Stealth Tank `CHFlame`
route remain separate policy decisions.

PR #347's safe tooling corrections are integrated here: the reference map now
labels its source-local rate as `damage/tick`, the accepted all-17 cargo-class
move is reflected in the pending map, and its Windows temp output is portable.
The proposed `is_upgrade_gated` rewrite remains excluded. Its satisfiability-only
selection would sum mutually exclusive Tesla Coil/IFV runtime modes and miss
some purchased-token names. The reference selector now delegates to the shared
built-state evaluator used by Formula V2, with focused Tesla Coil, IFV and GDI
battle-tank regressions. The existing strongest-armament fallback remains a
diagnostic limitation when no priced armament is active; it does not certify an
unknown condition as a live baseline weapon.

The four-faction review map was regenerated from that selector and the current
pending class map. The published HTML now reports **66 originals, 82 expanded,
270 references and 23 formula-priced rows**, labels the source-local rate as
`damage/tick`, and carries the approved `after` class column. It remains a
static review artifact; no proposal or gameplay value was applied.

### Latest Luna Max batch — GP-02 contract hardening

The reconstruction admission check in `tools/balance/assemble_four_voice_pilot.py`
now reads a separate version-1 JSON receipt from an explicit portable evidence
root. It verifies the receipt's SHA-256, exact frozen-baseline and selected-dataset
hashes/schema, reviewed scope, method, normalization and source-hash provenance,
and validates coherent source-state fields (`clean_commit`/`dirty_worktree`,
matching `dirty` boolean, explicit reconciliation and the baseline's exact
`worktree_head` when supplied). The immutable baseline is untouched. A malformed
or merely named evidence file
cannot bind the current Cameo dataset; substantive historical channel recovery
is still unperformed and the 29 selected groups remain withheld.

The synthesis gate also returns an unresolved diagnostic for non-string source
labels instead of raising. The affected contract test module passes **16/16**,
including both coherent source-state kinds, exact snapshot identity and
contradictory/invalid states.
A portable replay using the published packet passes through aggregation (**29/29**),
matches all **71/71** frozen inputs and preserves the expected **0/29** gate
resolution with `original_channel_reconstruction_not_verified`. Astra High's
read-only review accepted the patch, with source-hash values remaining format
validated rather than independently fetching their referenced source bytes.

The frozen-head investigation also produced a portable **candidate** under the
continuation packet: the clean source checkout at `9471672b` yields 2,306 records
(1,726 resolved and 133 unresolved), with four Mortar Soldier slot/weapon
mismatches retained as 20 unresolved scenario records. The snapshot explicitly
captures dirty local ledgers, so that commit is not proof of the captured source
state. The candidate remains unreviewed for substantive historical equivalence;
it does not satisfy the admission contract or unlock any armor vote.

### Latest Luna Max batch — armament-level support pricing

Point-defense interception is now represented as an armament-level pricing
decision. The extractor marks `pointdefense` and `pointdefensedeployed` routes
with `support_armament: true`, `pricing: false` and a reason, while keeping
their resolved weapon fields for route evidence. The refreshed ledgers contain
nine such routes on eight actors, including the Light Tank Mk. II. The
extractor also emits an `ALL_POSITIVE_ARMAMENTS_UNPRICED` guard for a buildable
actor whose non-support positive armaments are all excluded, and
`fit_class.pricing_armaments` refuses that guarded state. Support-only and
non-buildable actors remain valid zero-offense cases. The dedicated support
pricing tests pass **5/5**. The same reviewed batch adds one shared `PDLaser`
warhead target-mask correction for grounded and airborne projectile states;
damage, range, reload and ordinary-aircraft splash eligibility remain
unchanged, and runtime interception is still unverified.

- The reviewed continuation evidence is grouped in
  [astra_review_20260911](../audit/latest/astra_review_20260911/review.json).
  It records the exact 163-actor roster match, 71 recovered input hashes,
  restored Havoc behavior, Rapier's one-weapon/one-consumer closure and matching
  ledgers, promotion helper regressions and current proposal dispositions.
- Current supporting receipts are
  [promotion discount](../audit/latest/astra_review_20260911/promotion_discount.md),
  [replacement comparisons](../audit/latest/astra_review_20260911/promotion_replacements.md),
  [condition wiring](../audit/latest/astra_review_20260911/promotion_conditions.md),
  [channel comparison](../audit/latest/astra_review_20260911/four_voice_comparison.md)
  and [complete per-unit proposals](../audit/latest/astra_review_20260911/candidate_proposals.md).
  They supersede Sol's corresponding v2/v4/v2, consolidated and v3 receipts.
- The 1500-per-tier helper remains disconnected from extraction/writeback.
  It now rejects unknown promotion tokens, cyclic/missing parent chains and
  invalid numeric inputs. The 47 known consumers still resolve to tiers
  1/2/3/4 with counts 10/11/11/15.
- Reference map: 163 actors, 282 identity links and 195 peer cycle profiles.
  Of 55 ordinary armed actors with three assigned sources, 54 have full-source
  range and nominal-rate coverage. Spy's unarmed counterparts are accepted N/A.
  Sparse hero normalization remains separate. Links are not a completion rate.
- Pilot outgoing firepower: 30 actors / 100 weapon contexts converted to explicit
  damage; five isolated weapon variants protect other users. Percentage fractions
  are retained. The only flat rounding was Monster Tank 126262.5 to 126260 under
  Aedis's 10-point damage grid. Shared-default factors remain removed without
  compensation; local outgoing conversion does not restore them.
- Reviewed targeting and held missile-role corrections are applied. The target
  fixture covers 36 parent/emitter/fragment routes. Global role/class work is not
  claimed complete; V2 Tesla SCUD's parent Air role remains open.
- **All 11 valid full cargo loads now have matching prices.** The eight original
  transport price mismatches are fixed. Three passenger costs were rounded to the
  existing 10-credit grid: Machine Gunner 557 to 560, Dragunov 422 to 420, Officer
  1532 to 1530. Their nearest 100-credit slots are occupied by same-template-role
  siblings. No loads, weapons or HP changed in these price batches. K=1.25 remains
  an armed carrier's combat budget factor, not a purchase-price surcharge.
- **DTA generated inheritance gap corrected.** The supplied files retain
  BaseSection after client preprocessing. Copied-parent-key closure passes for
  all 781 inherited Rules and 89 Enhance sections. Of 1327 inherited Art sections,
  RAASTRP1U has a missing ASTRP1 parent. This is not game/client-version certification.
  Both 194-row DTA armor profile sets retain identical numeric/source fields;
  58 inheritance statuses per set and scope metadata were corrected. The atlas
  adapter now attaches authored weapon Damage to 80 selected DTA channel entries
  instead of leaving it blank. See `docs/reference/dta_preprocessing_evidence.json`.
- Building-shape review establishes one application per actor/channel/tick, with
  nearest-edge falloff rather than a hit per occupied cell. Fixed 50%/75% incoming
  protection is not a universal geometry correction. No HP, incoming multiplier
  or geometry change was applied. See `building-shape-review-20260911.json`.

## Implemented supporting work, still incomplete as requested deliverables

- Projectile comparison now covers 598 peer weapon records, 343 current Cameo
  armament weapons and 123 DTA weapon bindings. It provides 624 first-impact timing
  records for supported traveling/instant types. Guided arrival remains unmodeled;
  reviewed OpenRA launch/speed/acceleration parameters and 63 decoded DTA missile
  parameter sets are exposed separately. DTA's actual frame period remains unknown.
  Current Cameo fake tracers are cosmetic; streak-enabled bullets use the local
  ceiling rule. Source-position impacts and absent armament projectiles are not
  misrepresented as traveling hits. No speed/DPS vote changes are applied.
  See `docs/reference/PROJECTILE_TRAVEL.md`.
- Armor arithmetic supports four unique 25% voices, arithmetic/geometric means,
  an explicitly chosen blend and linear vehicle-endpoint interpolation. The
  current unsent atlas covers 163 actors / 1989 channels / 25 declared armor names (29 displayed axes after DTA fallback) and
  retains percentage-Versus fields. These helpers and channel traces are not the
  completed combined all-unit armor model or a global Versus proposal.
- Shrapnel helpers retain explicit target availability and random-hit assumptions.
  Zero simple domain mismatches does not close custom-tag, secondary-damage,
  spawned-actor or activation questions. A universal accidental-hit probability
  has not been approved.

## Remaining decisions and work

1. **Permanent Cameo channel self-vote:** all 71 original ledger inputs are
   recovered and hash-matched. They lack the full original target/Versus channel
   semantics needed for the armor vote. Derive reviewed reconstruction evidence
   in a separate contract; never edit the immutable actor snapshot, substitute
   current live channels, or renormalize the remaining three voices.
2. **V2 Tesla Air role:** keep the parent and fragments surface-only for now.
   Adding Air would create a new dual-domain artillery role and needs an explicit
   design decision plus runtime targeting/projectile review.
3. **Cargo policy is decided; implementation remains local and uncommitted.**
   Use the 10-credit grid for all unit/passenger prices. Naval transports keep no
   `InitialUnits` and are excluded from loaded-price valuation; their existing
   `MaxWeight` values remain untouched pending a separate manual-loading decision.
   Air transports use one of each available faction infantry, including promotions,
   and are priced only after infantry prices are set. Advanced armed transports use
   varied early-to-late infantry loads. The proposal records empty Landing Craft
   and Transport Submarine rows as `NOT_APPLICABLE`, and a six-member Nod Chinook
   load at weight 8/8 and sum 2650. Capacity must match modeled `InitialUnits`
   weight. No YAML changes for that later load proposal have been applied;
   the earlier cost-only corrections remain preserved.
4. **Incoming factors:** Bastion's saved 50%, Soviet/Nod SAM's 75% remain inactive.
   Aedis clarified their shape-compensation purpose. The static policy now
   retains realistic hitboxes and applies no universal HP or incoming factor;
   any area-damage-only compensation needs a separate approved pilot.
5. **Calibration:** 37 provisional flags in 14 of 23 evaluated classes remain. These are not
   37 proven gameplay defects. Triage model coverage and role/anchor validity;
   do not force prices to fit an incomplete model or call the failing check green.
6. **Armor:** combine applicable channels within each source, including max-HP
   terms, target states, cadence and armor mapping, before four equal votes.
   DTA's generated-key gap is resolved, but exact runtime applicability and
   secondary payloads remain limitations. DTA Light now follows its authored BaseArmor=wood fallback; Medium is not renamed.
7. **Target and secondary payloads:** the candidate still has 19 domain-audit
   rows requiring explicit interpretation, including Havoc's mixed payloads.
   Do not remove an existing weapon role merely to clear those rows. Global
   class/ancestry and custom-tag work remains a separate follow-on.
8. **Runtime/playtest:** no new launch/build occurred. Gameplay review remains
   outstanding. Japan, upgrade pricing and selective faction loading remain later
   work; no silent Sunday scope reduction is accepted.

## Validation and receipts

The Astra continuation review passed 39 focused helper/regression cases and
15 target-policy cases. The 47-actor promotion pricing probe remains resolved.
Filtered Allied extraction found exactly six raw and eleven derived differences,
all on Rapier's changed missile; those fields are synchronized. The staged
global model is unchanged. This is static evidence, not runtime approval.
The subsequent full-roster proposal extension passed its 11 focused tests and
reports 163 unique actors with no missing ledger rows. All proposal values and
class signatures remain unapproved; the older 31-row artifact is superseded by
`astra_review_20260911/candidate_proposals.json` and its Markdown companion.

The preserved implementation batch passed 30 focused checks (13 targeting,
6 firepower conversion, 4 cargo, 4 band membership, 3 armor arithmetic), plus the
formula-grid self-test. Resumed work adds eight projectile timing tests, one DTA speed-decoding test,
four DTA overlay tests and four DTA armor-fallback tests, all passing. No broad historical suite was rerun or claimed green.

Both cargo batches verify raw touched-file actor closure and resolved changed
actors, allowing only named Cost fields. All ledgers/sidecars were extracted into
staging once per price batch; only changed raw faction ledgers were copied back.
All staged derived outputs remained identical. Receipts and backups are in
`cargo-price-correction-20260911` and `cargo-grid-correction-20260911`; **do not replay
these mutations**. The latest correctly scoped band run confirms zero cargo price
mismatches, three load exceptions and the unchanged 37 provisional flags; exit 1
is expected. An initial empty run with faction aliases was discarded.

Latest sent map: `reference-map-20260911-projectile-travel` under external validation.
The 07:44 snapshot includes all cargo corrections and the projectile comparison.
It and the previous sent HTML snapshots are immutable. Current unsent armor atlas:
`four-faction-sunday-pilot/warhead-reference-freshness/armor-channel-atlas-20260911`.

## Historical Discord checkpoints

The current control-state and grand-plan instructions above supersede all
dated resume/monitoring/ownership language below. Historical successful checks
remain evidence for their stated scope; later planning corrections take priority
over the earlier promotion conclusions.

At 22:37 WIB, a native `[Codex]` Reply to Aedis's 21:02 handoff-document
clarification was delivered and verified as message `1547994534116462746`.
It points to the grand plan, this status and `docs/HANDOFF.md`, states that the
latest work is local/uncommitted, reports the GP-01 through GP-04 milestone and
asks for the V2 Tesla Air-role decision. It confirms no coordination framework
was set up and that the separate kmoney discussion can wait.

Native replies use [Codex]; Blackrobe shares the DM. Browser 2, current DM tab
282814854; reacquire current state after any restart and never reuse stale indices.
The earlier 11:25–11:28 cargo block is historical; its native `[Codex]` replies
were delivered and the composer was empty.

- 05:55 shape reply confirmed: 1547742228125057054.
- 06:26 DTA evidence correction confirmed later: 1547750105258524705.
- 06:35 cargo milestone and concrete payload-choice question sent; delivery is
  visible with empty composer. Settled receipt confirmed at 06:51:
  1547752287047385179.

Checks at 07:14 and 07:29 found no new incoming messages. The 07:44 combined
review reply is delivered (1547769750279426120); both HTML attachments and an empty
composer were verified. Subsequent checks through 09:10 WIB found no new
incoming messages; the later 17:01 Astor excerpt is recorded below.
The 17:01 Astor excerpt was read, the Cameo 1.1 backlog was captured, and a
native `[Codex]` Reply was delivered at 17:07 (message
`1547911338259382272`). The then-active deadline was 06:00 WIB on 12 September;
Blackrobe subsequently paused both implementation and monitoring for planning.


### Further armor-source work after 06:35

`docs/reference/dta_armor_evidence.json` resolves 194 warheads across 11 registered
armor types using reviewed Vinifera precedence: explicit warhead override, then
BaseArmor, then armor default. DTA defines Light -> Wood and Concrete -> Heavy.
Every original declared coefficient remains identical. Four focused tests cover
explicit zero, chained fallback precedence, defaults and invalid cycles/unsupported
positional data. The current unsent atlas shows derived entries separately from
raw declarations, with resolution routes and source hashes.

`docs/reference/dta_tesla_payload_evidence.json` traces the selected TeslaZap:
AmbientDamage is zero; its railgun particle system spawns non-damaging smoke
particles with no next-particle override. Additional HP damage is zero under the
reviewed OpenTS source model. Installed DTA binary applicability and firing cadence
remain separate uncertainties.

Three-defense HP-dependent armor-shape examples are in
`defense-armor-curves-20260911.json`, generated by
`tools/balance/compare_defense_armor_curves.py`. Cameo includes the folded main and
applicable flat chips; integrity/terrain effects are explicitly excluded. Reference
Light/Heavy endpoints map to Scout/Superheavy with three interpolated classes.
Four sources get 25% each, normalized to each source's Superheavy endpoint. This
supersedes neither the old main-channel comparison nor the unfinished full roster
model: it is a more complete, explicitly bounded set of examples.

The interactive HTML is saved externally at
`validation/defense-armor-curves-20260911/Defense-armor-shape-comparison.html`.
It lets the reviewer vary Cameo target max HP and explore an unadopted
arithmetic/geometric blend. Its generated JavaScript passed syntax checking.
Browser URL policy blocked the local-file preview; no workaround was attempted,
and visual review remains pending. This report was sent with the map at 07:44; its output folder now has a SENT.txt
hash/receipt lock. Do not regenerate into either sent output folder.

### Band triage and initial anchor proposals, 08:09–08:54 WIB

The band checker now uses the canonical fitting domain (ground when present,
otherwise AA) and charge-cycle inputs. This removes double-counting mutually
exclusive ground/AA weapons on Allied Heavy AA Tank and Soviet Gatling Tank;
it does not change their gameplay or certify AA-role calibration. Eight focused
membership/scope checks pass. There are still 37 provisional flags across 23
classes, plus the three cargo load exceptions; the diagnostic exits 1 as expected.
`band-scope-20260911.json` distinguishes baseline-active limitations from inactive
upgrade warnings. None of the 37 flags has an active shrapnel limitation; the
pilot's eligible Tesla Yak bomb is outside the current aircraft-free band cohort.

The unapproved anchor proposer contains 31 reference-complete contributors in
13 classes; six classes have at least three contributors. It preserves frozen
self votes and writes no registry or gameplay values. R4 reference DPS and the
canonical fitting reducer differ for some contributors (Shock Trooper 750 vs
500 is material). Shock Trooper's difference includes its flat ExtraDamage chip;
the smaller artillery/light-tank/recon-bike differences include legacy percentage
numerators being summed as flat values by R4. Those numerators are not flat HP.
Preserving an old reference metric does not certify its physical interpretation;
neither frozen votes nor projections may be silently rebased to hide the mismatch.
No conversion between those metrics is approved. Thin cohorts,
class-tag disagreements and cost residuals also require review before calibration.

First Luna batch: add explicit metric-basis diagnostics and a readable review
companion, preserving existing numerical proposals. File ownership is limited to
`tools/balance/propose_reference_anchors.py` and a new focused test module. Parent
reviews the diff and evidence without repeating successful checks unnecessarily.
Luna subagent: `/root/luna_implementation`, fresh history, GPT-5.6 Luna, Max.
The separate task `01a08e2b-94f7-7e23-9690-2b0f4fd4e3dc` stopped with no edits
and was archived after Blackrobe requested the subagent arrangement instead.
Evaluate end-to-end time including
review and corrections before widening delegation. Existing publication and
communication boundaries are unchanged.

Luna's first batch produced the review companion and seven passing focused tests.
Original candidate/contributor fields were compared against the pre-batch report
and preserved exactly: 13 classes, 31 contributors, 117 exclusions. Five R4/fitting
mismatches are now explicit. Parent reviewed the written implementation, test
coverage and report without rerunning the successful suite. Review requested the
missing spec columns and restoration of valid zero-numerator ratios. Both are
corrected; the affected seven-test module passed again in 0.021 seconds. Parent
accepts this bounded diagnostic batch. The final report is external
`reference-anchor-review-20260911-luna-subagent/review-dps-v3.md` with its paired
JSON. That JSON records the proposer hash before the last zero-ratio guard fix;
all cohort DPS values are positive, so the report values remain valid. No extra
live extraction was run solely to refresh that hash. The first implementation pass took
about 15 minutes (08:57–09:12), not the initially reported 25 minutes. Speed benefit
is not yet demonstrated; use bounded batches and reduce handoff/refinement loops.

Next armor-model implementation must group source channels by armament/state
before adding damage, then evaluate explicit target eligibility. The retained
CA Gatling Tank export contains MGattG twice: Armament@GROUND requires
gattling-ground < 14, while Armament@GROUND2 requires >= 14. Adding both selected
weapon rows doubles mutually exclusive states. Infantry-only percentage channels
and Medic healing also cannot enter generic vehicle damage curves. This is a
concrete synthesis requirement, not a reason to repeat the completed source audit.

### 09:29 continuation

Aedis DM has no new incoming message after 05:00; no reply was sent. Luna owns
the next bounded batch in `tools/balance/armor_projection.py` and new
`tools/tests/test_reference_channel_selection.py`: explicit slot/state and target
selection before source damage aggregation. Parent retains scenario choice and
final review. No existing defense behavior or gameplay values are to change.

Parent checked the actual CA export and pinned engine Warhead defaults: valid
Ground/Water, invalid empty, relationships Ally/Neutral/Enemy; invalid targets
override valid overlap. Integration scenarios after the helper is ready:
Gatling cold and warm Ground/Vehicle each select one flat-300 channel, whereas
Ground/Infantry also selects a percentage-6 channel that must not become flat HP.
CA AA gun against Air selects the 2500 main; Air+AirSmall selects both 2500
channels. Enemy Healable excludes all four Medic channels; Ally Healable retains
the healing channels (-3500 and three delayed -500), outside offensive flat-DPS
synthesis. These are explicit filter scenarios, not observed runtime targets or
whole-weapon combat certification. Review Luna's completed diff/check evidence,
then exercise the selector against these retained exports without repeating its
focused unit tests.

### 09:51–09:57 review

No new Aedis messages. Parent accepted Luna's channel-selector batch after two
corrections: preserve case-sensitive target/slot tokens, and mark missing direct
weapon target masks unresolved. Luna's affected selector/armor tests pass 11/11;
parent did not rerun them. The implementation finished around 09:36, but review
waited for the next heartbeat until 09:51. That scheduling gap is avoidable
coordination overhead; use completion-driven review during an active work turn.

Eight retained-export impact-filter scenarios pass; receipt and reproducible
driver are external under `validation/reference-channel-selection-20260911`.
They confirm disjoint Gatling states, infantry percentage separation, AA subtype
channels and allied-only healing. Initial direct-mode integration correctly
withheld Gatling's null exported weapon target mask; the final scenarios
explicitly exercise impact eligibility, not attack acquisition. Raw exports and
gameplay remain unchanged. Next step is consuming this selector in the combined
per-source armor synthesis; the helper alone does not complete the roster model.

Luna now owns `tools/balance/reference_channel_curves.py` and its new focused
test module: a consumer compiling separate source/slot/weapon scenarios from the
retained pilot matrix. It will represent supported authored flat and max-HP
channels as A+B*H, preserve alternate conditions, and explicitly withhold
unsupported selected payloads/adapters. No four-source vote or live rebalance is
authorized by this diagnostic. Parent corrected the scenario masks from source:
RA uses GroundActor/AirborneActor, TD and CA use Ground/Air; ordinary CA buildings
also carry Building. Prototype masks and source armor axes remain explicit,
not a claim to cover every actor state. Percentage numerators stay fractions,
not flat HP. Review completion in this active turn to avoid another heartbeat gap.

The first consumer report is now reviewed: 1,196 source/slot/scenario records,
470 resolved nominal curves, 265 target-excluded scenarios, 461 unresolved
(360 unsupported-source records, principally the separate DTA adapter). Ten
focused tests pass; parent reviewed code and retained examples without rerunning
the suite. External `validation/reference-channel-curves-20260911/` contains the
`reference_channel_curves_final` JSON/Markdown pair. The JSON is 51 MB because it
retains repeated raw evidence; prefer the 255 KB Markdown for human review.
These counts are not actors, source votes, or overall completion percentages.

Parent's source review resolved the missing common HealthPercentageDamage armor
default: it inherits DamageVersus through TargetDamage, so an undeclared armor
factor is 100. Proof with retained engine hash bindings is in
`docs/reference/openra_percentage_armor_evidence.json`. Luna is applying that
supplement to the consumer only when the matrix's base-class hashes match;
explicit coefficients/zeros remain authoritative. This should resolve CA Sniper
and Gatling infantry terms without changing the raw exports or admitting the
separate custom clamped-percentage type. Review that narrow evidence update next.

The percentage-default update is now reviewed: 14 focused tests pass, raw inputs
remain unchanged, and the latest `reference_channel_curves_percentage` pair has
476 resolved, 265 not-applicable and 455 unresolved records. Sniper infantry
retains A=0/B=3 for absent armor entries and its authored Light override B=0.75.
Each Gatling state independently retains flat and percentage terms (None A=480,
B=0.06; authored Light B=0.0006). This is nominal per-emission data, not cadence.

The remaining supported-source gaps are 92 missing-channel scenarios and three
CA MarauderDiscs clamped-HP scenarios. Parent inspected its pinned custom C#:
reference HP is capped at 60000 then floored at 30000 before percentage/armor
modifiers. `docs/reference/ca_clamped_percentage_evidence.json` records the exact
source commit/blob and sample values. A future adapter must preserve that
piecewise HP component, not pretend it is one global affine A+B*H term.

Clamped support is now reviewed and implemented as separate components, preserving
all previous A/B terms. Eighteen focused tests pass. Latest external
`reference_channel_curves_clamped` pair: 479 resolved, 265 not-applicable,
452 unresolved records. MarauderDiscs retains max(30000,min(H,60000)); the
3 former unsupported selected-payload scenarios are resolved. Remaining
OpenRA-source omissions are 92 missing-channel scenarios, distinct from 360
records awaiting the DTA source adapter. No full combat or four-voice approval
is implied by these nominal source coefficients.

Parent reviewed DTA particle/railgun behavior and recorded
`docs/reference/dta_additional_payload_evidence.json`. XORail's Damage=0 does
not make it harmless: AmbientDamage=150 is applied once per collected target by
the railgun routine. Listed Smoke/Railgun particles add no HP damage under the
reviewed OpenTS code. HornetLauncher (spawned aircraft) and Suicide (death payload)
must remain withheld rather than be priced as authored damage1/0.

Luna owns the next bounded files `tools/balance/dta_channel_curves.py` and its
focused test module. It will compile explicitly conditional eligible-impact
damage bases with direct/beam terms and matched DTA armor evidence. It must not
invent DTA target masks, use AA/AG as collateral immunity, or average this basis
into the other sources automatically. Parent retains final integration/review.

DTA basis adapter is now reviewed. Seven focused tests pass; final
`validation/dta-channel-curves-20260911/dta_channel_curves_deduplicated` pair has
72 base-channel results and 18 dispositions. Identical trace rows for Tanya,
Volkov and both commandos came from Primary/Secondary naming the same weapon;
the per-weapon adapter counts that payload once and records duplicate count2.
Conflicting duplicates remain withheld. XORail correctly separates direct0 from
ambient150 (375 after its None250% armor coefficient). No target immunity or
firing cadence is inferred by this conditional DTA impact basis.

Parent reused matching projectile-declaration audits to classify all 37 missing
selected-weapon traces. `docs/reference/pilot_weapon_absence_evidence.json` binds
the exact source corpus hashes: 32 references have no armament, four use CA's
DropDummy with no warhead, and one uses zero-damage DemoTruckTargeting. This
explains the absent direct-weapon curves; it does not make death explosions,
deploy effects or passengers harmless. Do not treat these as 37 missing data bugs.

Luna now owns the current-Cameo adapter in `tools/balance/cameo_channel_curves.py`
and its focused tests. It reuses existing heaviness/percentage arithmetic and
preserves actor/armament states, folded and standalone HP fractions, and flat
chips. Unsupported eligible shrapnel is withheld, not silently ignored. Parent
prepares final comparison/report integration while Luna implements and checks.

### 11:05 source-model milestone delivered

The reviewed current-Cameo adapter uses rounded folded units, honors standalone
percentage falloff, and retains damage-less FireShrapnel as unresolved. Eight
focused checks pass. Corrected output: 2,306 records, 1,640 resolved, 512
target-excluded, 133 unresolved and 21 no-armament records. Of the unresolved
scenarios, 117 contain shrapnel and 16 contain OpenToppedDamage passenger effects.
These are per-state records, not actor counts or gameplay failures.

Parent built the offline `Pilot-weapon-armor-inspector.html`: 163 actors and
3,232 compact source records, independent native-HP controls, explicit weapon/state
selection, and optional normalization to Superheavy. It includes absence evidence
and does not invent four-source averaging or apply gameplay changes. JavaScript
syntax/arithmetic checks and a mock-DOM smoke over 163 actors/five scenarios pass;
visual browser QA is not claimed. The earlier local-file browser policy block
was not bypassed.

Sent once to Aedis at 11:05 as a native reply to his all-unit armor request,
prefixed [Codex]. Settled message `1547820431489110036`, replying to
`1547720813006954566`; attachment delivery and empty composer verified. External
`validation/source-channel-inspector-20260911/SENT.txt` locks the sent HTML hash.
The message explicitly states that shrapnel/passenger/special payloads,
four-source synthesis, calibration and playtesting remain unfinished. No new
incoming Aedis message was present. No new commit, push, merge or runtime launch.

### Follow-ups after the sent milestone

Passenger handling is now split in the unsent Cameo source output: OpenToppedDamage
never damages the carrier directly; it dispatches to passenger-damage traits.
Sixteen scenarios now expose the primary-target HP curve separately with unresolved
passenger components and `full_effect_resolved=false`. Eleven focused tests pass;
ordinary curve values are unchanged. Latest unsent pair is
`cameo_channel_curves_passengers`; 117 shrapnel scenarios still withhold totals.
The sent 11:05 HTML remains immutable.

Parent audited the DPS basis against verified frozen raw-ledger backups for all
31 anchor contributors; evidence is external `validation/frozen-fitting-basis-20260911`.
Example GDI Minigunner: frozen raw R4 135.593221, frozen canonical main fitting
17.898305, current main fitting 32.542373. The original local24% multiplier was
baked, while inherited GlobalBuffs50% and InfantryBuff110% were intentionally
removed. Current/frozen main therefore rises1.818182 even though raw R4 falls.
This is not a reason to rewrite frozen votes or infer a regression from the raw
column. Any future normalization-basis migration must remain explicit and use the
verified pre-reference inputs, not current-stat feedback. No anchors/prices changed.

### 11:05–11:34 source-channel and cargo-policy milestone

The roster-wide weapon/armor inspector sent to Aedis at 11:05 covers 163 pilot
actors and keeps alternate states, flat damage, percentage damage and the CA
clamped-HP component explicit. DTA XORail's 150 ambient beam damage is separate
from its zero direct bullet damage. It is a source-model inspector, not completed
balancing; shrapnel, passenger, special-payload, cadence, four-source synthesis,
calibration and playtesting remain open.

Luna's source-channel batch added explicit per-slot/target/relationship selection
and ship scenarios. The external report contains 1,495 records: 630 resolved,
565 unresolved and 300 not applicable. The 299 ship records include 151 resolved
(Combined Arms 100, OpenRA Red Alert 26, OpenRA Tiberian Dawn 25) and 113 DTA
unsupported records; submerged/state-specific tags remain outside scope. Luna's
comparison against the prior 1,196 non-ship records reported zero key or
full-record differences. Nineteen focused tests passed. No gameplay, Versus,
engine or frozen-baseline values changed.

Aedis's 11:25–11:28 cargo decisions are recorded in the existing design and
proposal files: use the 10-credit grid; naval transports have no `InitialUnits`
and are excluded from loaded-price valuation; air transports use one of each
available faction infantry including promotions, with infantry priced first;
advanced armed transports prefer varied early-to-late loads; modeled capacity
matches `InitialUnits` weight. The two empty naval rows remain proposal-level
`NOT_APPLICABLE` with capacities 10 and 5 retained pending the manual-loading
interpretation. The Nod Chinook proposal has six varied passengers at weight 8/8
and sum 2650. No YAML load, capacity or cost change was applied. Native `[Codex]`
replies were sent to each new request.

The source-channel report is external at
`validation/reference-channel-curves-20260911/reference_channel_curves_ships.json`
and its Markdown companion. The cargo policy is near `docs/DESIGN.md:536`, and
the proposal is `docs/balance/cargo-load-proposal-20260911.json`. Parent reviewed
both Luna batches and their focused evidence without rerunning successful tests.
At 06:00 WIB on 12 September stop implementation, DM checks and replies and hand
off remaining calibration, synthesis, capacity interpretation and playtesting work.

### 11:36 aircraft-armor clarification

Aedis clarified that the reference mods do not have Cameo's aircraft armor
types. Their Light-to-Heavy aircraft curve must map to **Fighter, Bomber,
Helicopter, Spaceship** at equal steps. A native `[Codex]` reply confirmed that
this will remain a separate diagnostic interpolation and will not alter live
armor or Versus values. Luna owns the bounded implementation in
`tools/balance/reference_channel_curves.py` and its existing focused test module;
the fresh report will be written under
`validation/reference-channel-curves-aircraft-20260911`. The prior ship report
remains unchanged.

At 11:38 Blackrobe extended the authorized implementation and Aedis-monitoring
window to **06:00 WIB on 12 September 2026**. The existing heartbeat was updated
and verified active with a clean prompt after removing an accidental stale
PowerShell error prefix. Continue bounded work and quiet 15-minute checks until
that cutoff; do not infer new publication or merge authority.

At 11:47 Aedis added projectile spread/impact radius and falloff to the reference
review, with an explicit instruction that these numbers remain unapproved until
reviewed. A native `[Codex]` reply confirmed that speed, spread and falloff will
stay source-local reference measurements, separate from DPS and armor, with no
YAML or runtime changes. Luna's next bounded batch is the new
`tools/balance/reference_weapon_geometry.py` extractor and focused tests; it will
record raw fields and coverage gaps without normalizing across engines.

The geometry inventory is complete in external
`validation/reference-weapon-geometry-20260911/reference_weapon_geometry.json`
and its Markdown companion. It contains 1,332 records (Cameo 1,031; Combined
Arms 153; DTA Enhanced 80; OpenRA Red Alert 39; OpenRA Tiberian Dawn 29), with
1,319 records carrying at least one absent/malformed/inherited-unresolved field,
five malformed records and 13 source tokens left unparsed. DTA `range` and
`projectilerange` remain separate. Six focused tests pass and the input guard is
unchanged. This is coverage evidence only: raw geometry is not normalized across
engines, and no speed, spread, falloff or YAML value was changed.

### 12:09 geometry-shape summary and delegation update

The follow-up summary groups all 1,332 geometry records into 12 source/type
groups. It reports 844 records with numeric Falloff tokens, 13 groups with
repeated Falloff values, and descriptive zero-index/first/last/monotonicity
metrics. It does not compare source-local units or propose values. Four focused
tests pass; the fresh external pair is under
`validation/reference-weapon-geometry-summary-20260911`.

Blackrobe has now authorized multiple subagents when useful. Luna remains the
implementation workhorse. A read-only adversarial reviewer was stopped after its
review time exceeded the likely benefit; the read-only next-milestone planner
returned its recommendation and was stopped. Their scopes excluded edits,
publication, runtime actions and duplicate successful checks. Parent retains all
planning, coordination, difficult decisions and final review. Evaluate total
delivery time and stop delegation if it adds overhead.

The planner ranked a fail-closed four-source synthesis gate as the next
highest-benefit batch. Existing Cameo, OpenRA/CA and DTA adapters use different
armor axes and state keys, so source joins must be explicit; missing or unresolved
voices must remain unresolved rather than be renormalized. Luna is implementing
that generic gate in `tools/balance/four_source_synthesis_gate.py` with focused
tests, carrying clamped HP and direct/ambient terms separately. It will not infer
joins or write Versus/YAML values.

### 12:36 maintenance pause

Blackrobe requested a maintenance pause. All subagents are stopped and the
Aedis heartbeat `aedis-dm-follow-up-until-05-00-wib` is **PAUSED**; its clean
prompt still targets 06:00 WIB on 12 September 2026 and permits bounded Luna
subagents. No DM check or reply will be attempted while paused.

The next synthesis gate was started locally after two Luna handoff attempts
stalled. New files `tools/balance/four_source_synthesis_gate.py` and
`tools/tests/test_four_source_synthesis_gate.py` are written but **untested and
unreviewed**. No external gate report was generated. On resume, first run only
the focused gate test, review its fail-closed semantics, then decide whether to
continue with a fresh Luna task or retain parent ownership. Preserve all prior
external reports, dirty work and publication boundaries.

### 12:43 synthesis-gate focused check and resume

After maintenance, the Aedis heartbeat was reactivated with its existing
15-minute cadence and 06:00 WIB 12 September 2026 cutoff. The focused gate run
first exposed a test expectation that omitted the source prefix from missing-axis
reasons. Fresh GPT-5.6 Luna Max work changed only
`tools/tests/test_four_source_synthesis_gate.py` so the test requires all four
explicit `axes:<source>:missing_common_axes:Scout,Medium,Superheavy` reasons;
the implementation remains unchanged. Luna's focused command passed all seven
tests. The gate remains diagnostic-only, no external report was generated, and
no YAML, runtime, build, commit, push, merge or publication action occurred.

### 12:45 Aedis armor-axis policy clarification

Aedis confirmed separate mappings for the pending four-source synthesis:
infantry maps None to None and Light to Plate with Flak between; vehicles map
Light and Heavy directly, extrapolate Scout below Light and Superheavy above
Heavy, and interpolate Medium; aircraft map Fighter, Bomber, Helicopter and
Spaceship at equal steps between the reference Light and Heavy endpoints. This
prevents Scout and Plate aliasing and permits Cameo Superheavy to exceed the
reference Heavy endpoint. A native [Codex] reply recorded the policy. The
current gate remains generic and diagnostic-only; these ladders must be explicit
before any source averages are generated.

### 13:01 explicit armor-ladder policy batch

Fresh GPT-5.6 Luna Max work extended the gate with an opt-in
scenario_policy=True switch. It now records explicit diagnostic mappings for
infantry (None/Flak/Plate), vehicles and ships (Scout/Light/Medium/Heavy/
Superheavy with one-step endpoint extrapolation), and aircraft
(Fighter/Bomber/Helicopter/Spaceship). Unknown scenarios, missing endpoints,
negative extrapolated terms and incomplete four-source groups remain unresolved;
the four voices still receive equal weight and both means remain separate.

Parent review caught and Luna corrected a legacy compatibility regression:
arbitrary scenario labels remain accepted when the new switch is off, while
unknown labels fail closed when it is on. The focused gate command passed 12/12.
No source report, YAML, runtime, build, commit, push, merge or publication action
occurred.

### 13:15 trait-level secondary-route inventory milestone

Fresh GPT-5.6 Luna Max work added the bounded diagnostic helper
`tools/audit/secondary_payload_routes.py` with focused synthetic tests in
`tools/tests/test_secondary_payload_routes.py`. The explicit allowlist records
casing, aircraft-fall, death, periodic-fire and known impact/support weapon
references, including the legacy `Explodes` alias. It preserves raw tokens,
source locations, resolved/missing status and duplicate occurrences without
inferring damage, activation, reachability, geometry or DPS.

Luna's focused command passed 4/4. A read-only active-rules inventory found
10,494 unique resolved routes across 2,183 concrete actors: casing 29,
falls-to-earth 122, periodic-fire 48, impact/support 5, death weapon 5,297
and death fallback 4,993; no missing references or duplicate occurrences were
reported. The large death-route count reflects inherited default explosion
traits and is inventory evidence, not a balance total. No source report, YAML,
runtime, build, commit, push, merge or publication action occurred.

A native `[Codex]` reply reporting this milestone was sent to Aedis's 11:47
reference-only request at 13:18 WIB; no additional DM report was sent.

### 13:33 explicit source-channel reducer milestone

Fresh GPT-5.6 Luna Max work added the review-only reducer
`tools/balance/source_channel_reducer.py` and ten focused tests. It sums only
caller-selected, already-resolved rows within one explicit source,
comparison, scenario and state group, preserving the caller's axes verbatim.
Missing or conflicting group metadata, unresolved rows, malformed or negative
terms, duplicate channel identities and non-finite totals fail closed with no
partial terms. Clamped-HP, direct and ambient evidence remain separate, and
the result records that selection, joins, axis policy and writeback are
caller-owned or disabled.

The focused command passed 10/10, and a separate synthetic execution verified
the resolved A/B sum and direct-versus-ambient evidence separation. Parent
review found no implementation defect. No source report, YAML, runtime,
build, commit, push, merge or publication action occurred; the reducer is
ready for the later explicit per-source group assembly.

### 13:48 four-source coverage blocker inventory

The next synthesis-critical check is now explicit in
`tools/audit/four_source_group_inventory.py`, with six focused tests. It
inspects the existing 163-actor pilot matrix without deriving any join,
scenario, state key, armor mapping or vote. The matrix contains 282 reference
links but no actor has exactly one retained row from all four required voices;
the current coverage is Combined Arms 123, DTA Enhanced 90, OpenRA Red Alert
35 and OpenRA Tiberian Dawn 34. Missing-source actor counts are 40, 73, 128
and 129 respectively, with no duplicate fixed-source rows.

The matrix also carries no explicit `comparison_id`, `scenario` or `state_key`
on its actor/reference rows, and its reference statuses/terms are not in the
gate's `RESOLVED` shape. The inventory therefore reports 0 complete and 0
gate-ready four-source actors; this is the concrete reason a four-way Range or
DPS vote cannot yet be claimed. The focused command passed 6/6, and the
actual import-only inventory completed without mutating its input. No source
report, YAML, runtime, build, commit, push, merge or publication action
occurred.

A native `[Codex]` Reply with these coverage results was sent to Aedis's
reference-only request at 13:49 WIB; no additional report was sent.

### 14:01 four-voice contract correction

The 13:48 inventory's fixed-four-reference reading was too strict for
Aedis's recorded 25% rule. That rule is **Current Cameo plus exactly three
distinct reference voices**, with the third reference explicitly chosen from
Combined Arms, OpenRA Red Alert, OpenRA Tiberian Dawn or DTA Enhanced. The
legacy fixed-four-reference behavior remains available, but the gate now has
an explicit `voice_policy=True` mode for the actual Aedis contract; it records
the four voices and equal 0.25 weights without selecting a missing source.

The corrected inventory finds 60 four-voice coverage candidates among 163
actors (142 have channel-bearing Current Cameo input); 59 have channel-bearing
reference rows. None is gate-ready yet because the pilot matrix still lacks
explicit `comparison_id`, `scenario`, `state_key` and resolved affine terms.
The corrected gate tests pass 15/15, the inventory tests pass 6/6, and a
one-group voice-policy execution resolves 1/1. No source report, YAML,
runtime, build, commit, push, merge or publication action occurred.

A native `[Codex]` correction Reply was sent to Aedis at 14:03 WIB. It
clarifies that the 25% contract is Current Cameo plus three distinct reference
voices, and records the corrected 60 candidate / 0 gate-ready result. No
additional milestone report was sent.

### 14:19 explicit voice-row assembly milestone

The review-only `tools/balance/explicit_voice_group_assembler.py` now projects
caller-selected dataset/record-index selections into gate-compatible source
rows. It requires explicit `comparison_id`, `scenario`, `state_key`, one
Current Cameo voice and exactly three distinct reference voices; it preserves
raw records and identity fields and fails closed on missing, duplicate,
malformed, mismatched or non-RESOLVED inputs. It never matches actors,
weapons, scenarios or states and performs no normalization or writeback.

Ten focused tests pass, including an integration assertion through the
corrected voice-policy gate. Parent review also hardened malformed
dataset/source values to remain unresolved instead of raising type errors. A
synthetic integration passes the assembled rows through that gate with equal
0.25 weights and the vehicle ladder. The helper is ready for a future
hand-authored selection file;
the existing pilot still has no explicit group metadata and remains
gate-blocked. No external report, YAML, runtime, build, commit, push, merge or
publication action occurred.

A native `[Codex]` Reply reporting this milestone was sent to Aedis's 11:47
reference-only request at 14:24 WIB (message `1547870436715401258`). No
additional DM report was sent.

The attempted Luna implementation batch stalled and was stopped. Because that
delegation added waiting overhead in this continuation, no further subagent
tasks will be spawned; parent implementation and review continue directly.

The explicit selection handoff is documented in
`docs/balance/FOUR_VOICE_GROUP_SELECTION.md`. It defines the caller-owned
dataset/index manifest, the exact Current Cameo plus three-reference contract,
raw metadata checks and the diagnostic armor ladders without inventing a
cross-source join.

The active Aedis heartbeat was updated to remove subagent delegation while
preserving its 15-minute cadence, quiet notification policy and 06:00 WIB
12 September cutoff.

### 15:34 half-done diagnostic-preparation milestone

The hand-authored vehicle cohort now contains 12/12 groups assembled and
resolved through the explicit Current Cameo plus three-reference gate: three
each for RA Allies, RA Soviets, TD GDI and TD Nod. DTA's
`BASE_CHANNELS_RESOLVED` status is admitted only through the named
`DTA_BASE_CHANNELS_RESOLVED` alias; raw status, selected indexes, scenario
policy and equal 0.25 weights remain in the receipt. The permanent current
Cameo baseline is linked by SHA-256 provenance.

The receipt is `docs/audit/latest/four_voice_pilot_v4_20260911.json` with the
paired Markdown summary. This is static review evidence only: no YAML, runtime,
Versus value, build, commit, push, merge or publication action occurred.

A native `[Codex]` Reply reporting this milestone was sent to Aedis at 15:34
WIB. Further DM reporting remains milestone-only.

### 15:47 explicit per-source channel aggregation

The pilot driver now reduces each selected source from its explicit resolved
`channel_terms` before passing it to the four-voice gate. Current Cameo
flat/percentage channels, reference A/B channels and DTA direct/ambient
channels are translated only into the reducer's explicit A/B shape; each sum
is checked against the adapter's selected-record `terms`. Clamped-HP, direct
and ambient evidence stays separate, and missing or malformed channel detail
falls back only with a named provenance limitation. The final v6 receipt shows
12/12 aggregation-resolved and 12/12 gate-resolved groups, with the frozen
Cameo baseline hash retained.

Focused assembler/driver tests pass 17/17 and both changed modules compile.
No source join, balance writeback, runtime, build, commit, push, merge or
publication action occurred.

### 15:48 baseband flag triage

The existing 83-row baseband report is now classified by
`tools/balance/triage_band_flags.py` without changing its values. All 37 flags
are retained: 19 hard-low (<50%), 13 soft-low (50–75%) and 5 hard-high (>350%).
Thirty rows remain in the anchor/input lane; seven are routed to class
membership review because their classes are derived rather than explicit.
Unsigned class anchors remain a blocker on every flag, and no automatic
reprice or anchor move is proposed.

The focused triage command passes 5/5. Receipt:
`docs/audit/latest/band_flag_triage_20260911.json` with the paired Markdown
review. This is a review queue, not calibration or gameplay evidence.

### 15:53 component-separated channel receipt

The four-voice pilot now records, for every source in each selected group,
flat A terms, max-HP B terms, direct components, ambient components and
clamped-HP components as separate diagnostic fields. Channel sums are checked
against each adapter's selected-record terms before the gate; the 12/12
aggregation and 12/12 gate result remains resolved. Receipt:
`docs/audit/latest/four_voice_pilot_v6_20260911.json` with the paired Markdown
summary. The larger JSON retains raw channel evidence; no gameplay value is
written or inferred.

### 15:56 active targeting and payload receipts

Fresh read-only inventories now bind the current active ruleset. The
trait-level allowlist resolves 10,494 unique secondary routes across casing,
falls-to-earth, periodic-fire, impact/support and death payload fields, with no
missing or duplicate occurrences. The target-mask graph covers 1,709 direct
weapons and 1,867 visited root/weapon pairs; it records 49 air-only surface
edges, 45 surface-only air edges, 105 dual-root air exclusions and 32 dual-root
surface exclusions, plus 56 secondary candidates. Custom tags, selection-only
semantics, geometry and runtime activation remain explicit limitations.

Receipts: `docs/audit/latest/secondary_payload_routes_20260911.json` and
`docs/audit/latest/target_payload_routes_20260911.json`. No role-family change,
YAML writeback, runtime, build, commit, push, merge or publication action
occurred.

### 16:12 FireShrapnel scenario receipt

The new review-only `tools/balance/shrapnel_scenario_report.py` walks the
resolved active ruleset and records 200 terminating FireShrapnel weapon chains,
369 reachable emission edges, 160 actor bindings and a maximum chain depth of
five. It evaluates two named scenarios through the existing recursive helper:
unlimited eligible targets and zero eligible actors, honoring
`ThrowWithoutTarget` and the explicit 0.50 random-hit credit convention. Child
Burst and ReloadDelay are not treated as extra emissions.

The receipt separates flat authored payloads from percentage/folded and
integrity channels. Thirty roots are flat-only; 170 retain a percentage or
integrity limitation. Parent, emitter and fragment masks remain raw and
source-located: 245 edges match at the domain level, 32 differ and 92 require
custom-tag review. These are review lanes, not automatic fixes; spawner and
drop-pod routes may intentionally use different masks and remain policy/runtime
questions.

Focused shrapnel, target-payload and secondary-route tests pass 32/32, and the
tool compiles. No price, DPS vote, armor result, YAML, runtime, build, commit,
push, merge or publication action occurred. Receipt:
`docs/audit/latest/shrapnel_scenario_20260911.json` with the paired Markdown
summary. The remaining work is target/armor/falloff integration, status/value
policy and global role review.

Aedis's new 16:00 question about removing bot-module advantages (vision,
production speed, cost bonuses and passive income) is recorded as a deferred
post-rebalance architecture estimate. No bot work is mixed into this candidate.

### 16:22 missile role/class triage receipt

The read-only `tools/balance/triage_missile_role_cases.py` receipt now adds
inheritance, resolved source locations and concrete actor `Weapon:` consumers
to the remaining role-family audit. The active ruleset has 378 concrete
Missile-family weapons: 15 ground-only MissileAP routes (R1), 8 air-only
MissileAP routes (R2), and 5 dual-domain MissileHE routes (R3/R4). R4 is the
same five MissileHE-against-Air findings as R3, not five additional weapons.
The receipt also retains 27 custom selectors and three V2 Tesla SCUD
parent/fragment policy rows; custom recipient tags and naval selectors remain
outside the three-domain rule.

This is review context only. No family, `ValidTargets`, `InvalidTargets`,
damage, projectile or Versus value was changed. The JSON and Markdown receipts
are `docs/audit/latest/missile_role_triage_20260911.json` and
`docs/audit/latest/missile_role_triage_20260911.md`; the three focused triage
tests pass and the tool compiles.

### 16:31 missile role decision packet

The review-only `tools/balance/prepare_missile_role_decisions.py` packet groups
the raw R1-R4 findings by concrete weapon, merging the five duplicate R3/R4
rows. It leaves 28 unique strict cases: five dual-domain MissileHE/Air
absolute-rule cases and 23 single-domain role reviews. Nine rows are elevated
because they have multiple actor consumers; 14 have no resolved actor
`Weapon:` consumer and remain reachability questions. The 27 custom selectors
are summarized separately by naval, recipient-type and custom-vocabulary
lanes, and the three V2 Tesla SCUD parent/fragment rows remain explicit policy
questions.

Focused packet and triage tests pass 6/6, and both modules compile. The packet
selects no family and makes no target, damage, projectile, Versus, runtime or
publication change. Receipts:
`docs/audit/latest/missile_role_decisions_20260911.json` and the paired
Markdown summary.

### 16:37 Sonic/Cryo status-route audit

The active status inventory now records 26 condition names, including 12
`SonicDebuff` emitters and one `CryoFreeze` emitter, with their resolved actor
consumer types and direct bindings. `CryoFreeze` is emitted by
`HueyCryoMissiles` only under the Iroquois Cryo upgrade; its condition-token
consumers are visible even though no concrete `ExternalCondition` receiver
declares the token directly. The physical-state audit passes across 2,448
concrete weapons and six Flame/Chemical templates, with no same-meter
damage-scaled plus fixed-state double application.

This closes the static Sonic/Cryo route audit before further role decisions;
status scalar valuation, uptime, resistance and upgrade pricing remain
deferred. Receipts:
`docs/audit/latest/status_effect_inventory_20260911.json`,
`docs/audit/latest/status_effect_inventory_20260911.md` and
`docs/audit/latest/physical_state_warheads_20260911.md`.
The corrected focused status, physical-state and Sonic checks pass 21/21.

### 16:48 mixed vehicle and infantry four-voice cohort

The gate now has a second hand-authored manifest,
`docs/balance/four_voice_selection_pilot_infantry_20260911.json`, which keeps
the original 12 vehicle groups and adds nine base infantry groups across RA
Allies, RA Soviets, TD GDI and TD Nod. Every selected row carries an explicit
dataset/index and identity guard; upgrade variants are excluded by the
recorded `requires` state. The driver now describes scenario policies per
group instead of labeling a mixed receipt as vehicle-only.

Receipt `docs/audit/latest/four_voice_pilot_v7_20260911.json` is fully
resolved: 21/21 assembled, 21/21 channel-aggregated and 21/21 gate-resolved.
The nine infantry groups use the named
`AEDIS_INFANTRY_NONE_LIGHT_TO_NONE_FLAK_PLATE` ladder; the original 12 retain
`AEDIS_VEHICLE_LIGHT_HEAVY_LADDER`. Equal 0.25 voice weights, DTA's explicit
base-channel alias and raw channel evidence remain visible. This is static
review evidence only; no YAML, runtime, Versus value, build, commit, push,
merge or publication action occurred.

### 16:53 aircraft-target four-voice extension

The cross-scenario manifest now adds eight base aircraft-target groups to the
12 vehicle and nine infantry groups. The selected current rows are explicit
aircraft-target evaluations; the reference adapters' `small_aircraft` label is
carried through an explicit `record_scenario` mapping rather than silently
renamed. The eight groups cover three RA Allies, two RA Soviets, one TD GDI and
two TD Nod cases, with DTA base-channel status admitted only through the
whitelisted alias.

Receipt `docs/audit/latest/four_voice_pilot_v8_20260911.json` is fully
resolved: 29/29 assembled, 29/29 channel-aggregated and 29/29 gate-resolved.
Its aircraft rows use `AEDIS_AIRCRAFT_LIGHT_HEAVY_LADDER`, producing separate
Fighter/Bomber/Helicopter/Spaceship axes; vehicle and infantry rows retain
their own policies. The Markdown renderer now lists the policy per scenario,
so mixed receipts do not describe themselves as vehicle-only. This remains
static review evidence: no YAML, runtime, Versus value, build, commit, push,
merge or publication action occurred.

### 16:55 FirepowerMultiplier static disposition

The W17 retirement worklist has been reviewed against the active balance
ledgers: 404 main warhead rows across 122 actors carry an unconditional
`FirepowerMultiplier`; all 404 fold within the 1% tolerance, with 392 exact
damage-grid results and 12 differing only by the final grid snap. No row needs
a separate damage decision under this diagnostic criterion.

The report now records the disposition: these rows are candidates for a
separately authorized set-B weapon-content batch, while the current pass does
not remove traits, edit YAML or claim runtime equivalence. The remaining
authorization boundary is explicit in `PROJECT_TODOS_20260911.md`.

### 17:04 shape-policy disposition

The existing nearest-edge shape receipt is now paired with an explicit static
policy: retain realistic hitboxes and make no universal HP or incoming-damage
adjustment. The evidence shows shape exposure varies with weapon falloff and
impact position, so a blanket factor would conflate footprint exposure with
armor. Any area-damage-only compensation remains a separate pilot requiring
explicit approval. No geometry, HP, multiplier or runtime value changed.

### 17:05 Cameo 1.1 bot-module backlog captured

Aedis supplied an Astor conversation and asked for usable Cameo 1.1 ideas.
The bounded backlog in
`docs/balance/CAMEO_1_1_BOT_MODULE_BACKLOG_20260911.md` separates deterministic
squad roles/formations, target priorities, artillery/assault timing, bounded
wave adaptation, air response, telemetry and fairness staging from the
higher-risk mob-system research. It preserves Aedis's current direction:
keep bot advantages while the AI improves, then reduce them one at a time
against measured parity evidence. Astor's claim that the CN mob system runs
well is recorded as unverified and requires profiling before reuse.

No bot, gameplay, YAML, engine, runtime or publication change occurred. This
backlog is deferred until the Cameo 1.0 rebalance candidate and Sunday
playtest are stable.

### 17:08 band-queue cross-check

The 37 provisional band flags remain a review queue: all 37 are still HOLD
because every row lacks a signed-off class anchor; seven also have an explicit
current actor in the 29-group channel receipt, while 30 do not. The channel
receipt does not resolve the separate cost/DPS anchor question. Seven rows
still carry derived-class membership and four retain an inactive-variant
limitation. No flag was repriced, rebased or converted into a gameplay action.

### 17:16 infantry/artillery pressure receipt

To make the late-game infantry concern measurable before choosing a gameplay
policy, the new review-only
`tools/audit/infantry_artillery_pressure.py` evaluates four explicit current
records: one base infantry target and one representative area weapon for each
RA Allies, RA Soviets, TD GDI and TD Nod. It keeps flat A and max-HP fraction B
separate and reports the uncapped target-HP bars for the None and Light source
axes under a named one-center-impact convention.

The receipt `docs/audit/latest/infantry_artillery_pressure_20260911.json` is
4/4 resolved. Its projections range from 1.51–3.09 target-HP bars on None and
1.26–2.57 on Light; these are arithmetic pressure indicators, not one-shot,
TTK or DPS claims because falloff, scatter, cadence, armor changes, movement,
area population and secondary payloads are excluded. The evidence now feeds a
separate survivability policy/playtest task; no infantry, artillery, HP,
armor, YAML or runtime value changed.

### 17:28 promotion-unit discount proposal

**Planning correction:** the 16.5% current-buff justification below is invalid
because it includes a commented-out firepower trait. Aedis accepted the pilot
direction at 17:32; correct its rationale through GP-01 before applying content.

The promotion request is now backed by a review-only calculation across 47
promotion-unlocked actors in the four current factions. The tool resolves
authored promotion-column depth (tiers 1–4), existing prerequisite-chain cost
`C`, and the rational `f(C)` curve, then compares a fixed 5000-credit virtual
prerequisite with 1000/1500/2000 credits per promotion tier.

The recommendation for a first bounded playtest is **1500 credits per
promotion tier**, with **2000 per tier** retained as an upper sensitivity case.
The current hidden buff's formula-only price effect (speed/range/firepower/
reload, excluding damage taken) is about 16.5%; the four-faction sample's mean
relative discounts are 18.5% for 1500-per-tier and 23.6% for 2000-per-tier.
The same scan finds 49 direct `^PromotionUnitBuff` inherits in the four
current factions: 40 on promotion units and nine on non-promotion actors,
while seven promotion-gated units have no direct inherit. The complete active
include graph has 251 direct inherits, of which 207 are on promotion-token
units and 44 are not. That prevents a blind all-promotion or all-inherit
removal.
The rational curve can leave early units on its `C <= B` plateau, so neither
candidate is a universal guarantee. Receipt:
`docs/audit/latest/promotion_discount_20260911.json` with the paired Markdown
detail. No promotion inherit, cost, YAML, runtime or playtest value changed.

### 17:52 promotion replacement superiority inventory

**Planning correction:** the comparisons and aggregate verdicts below are not
a valid superiority gate. Shared-token cross-joins create false replacements,
and the DPS/weapon selection can disagree. See E2–E3 in the grand plan.

The review-only `tools/audit/audit_promotion_superiority.py` now reads the
active replacement contract directly from negative `~!promotion` prerequisites;
it does not infer pairs from names or sprites. Across the four current factions
it found 48 promotion tokens and 47 buildable promotion consumers. Twenty-three
tokens carry an explicit base-disable marker, producing 26 comparison edges
(three tokens unlock multiple promotion actors); 21 consumers have no authored
base marker and remain mapping/design questions.

The receipt compares resolved HP, speed and armor plus the existing ledger's
default primary priced armament for nominal range, DPS and recognized warhead
class. Three pairs have no static defect under those limited metrics, 21 need
review and two are unresolved; the most frequent review signals are lower
range (10), lower or unchanged nominal DPS (9), and lower speed (12). These
signals are not automatic rebalance decisions: cargo, role changes, status,
secondary payloads, upgrades and runtime behavior still require separate
review. Focused audit tests pass 4/4 and the tool compiles. No promotion
inherit, cost, YAML, runtime, build, commit, push, merge or publication action
occurred. Receipts:
`docs/audit/latest/promotion_superiority_v3_20260911.json` and its paired
Markdown detail.

### 17:54 milestone reply and external-agent boundary

The promotion replacement receipt was sent to Aedis as a native Discord Reply
prefixed `[Codex]`. The same Reply gave a bounded architecture opinion for his
Claude/ChatGPT coordination question: use a shared task ledger or repository
with unique task IDs, claimed file scopes, branch/commit/receipt evidence and
one coordinator for integration; a direct model-to-model bridge adds state,
authentication and security complexity. No external-agent connection or other
setup was performed, and the architecture topic remains outside the Cameo 1.0
balance scope.

### 18:05 promotion and upgrade interaction inventory

**Planning correction:** this is a partial condition-source inventory, not proof
of a fresh state. Mixed known/unknown expressions and other condition sources
require the targeted E4 correction; broad unknown counts are not gameplay bugs.

The review-only `tools/balance/prepare_promotion_upgrade_interactions.py`
inventory separates the fresh promotion state from upgrade/doctrine wiring for
the 47 current promotion consumers. It confirms 40 direct
`^PromotionUnitBuff` inherits and seven promotion units without that direct
inherit. The resolved cohort contains 197 current-faction upgrade/doctrine
condition hooks and 510 conditional stat traits attached to those hooks; the
remaining unknown condition sources stay listed as unresolved rather than
being valued. This gives the Sunday no-upgrade comparison an explicit fresh
state and keeps upgrade valuation separate.

Focused interaction tests pass 2/2 and the tool compiles. No YAML, runtime,
build, commit, push, merge or publication action occurred. Receipt:
`docs/audit/latest/promotion_upgrade_interactions_20260911.json` with the
paired Markdown detail.
