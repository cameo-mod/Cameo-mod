# Overnight draft integration review

This is a local integration checkpoint, not a merged PR or gameplay-balance approval.

## Exact inputs

- PR341: `4b4b354f4914305e6a248ce15f83a233970ee400` (integration HEAD).
- PR339: `0a0b7f3d4dc8c1c1090e05d962c24b1a93bb3c76` (pending merge parent).
- PR340: `45444296545d0a4e1aaa994e8d3086e5b6b0cfec` (reviewed binary Git patch;
  source/test/map changes applied, generated outputs regenerated rather than patched).

The newer CA structured-corpus follow-up is not included in this first snapshot.
The engine directory is a read-only-use junction to PR341's verified engine/build.
No build is run through that junction. The main checkout and protected PRs are untouched.

## Findings and repairs

The initial combined run executed 1,867 Python tests: 16 failures, 9 errors and 64 skips;
peak sampled system memory was 78.40%, with no guard stop. This is not a green suite.
Compared with the final PR341 run, three additional cases appeared:

1. The CannonAP byte-identity test compared against moving Git HEAD. After publication,
   HEAD already contained the appended base, making its expected tail comparison invalid.
   The test now executes both tools and both profile JSON inputs from immutable upstream
   `50b7d001be845e0ac5a0812d2591e154148c94dc`. All 22 module tests pass. This is test-only;
   the generator, weapons and runtime are unchanged. Independent review found no blocker.
   Git history must contain that baseline revision; missing history fails explicitly.
2. Generated reference assignments retained old Soviet actor identities, breaking the
   paired-identity check and changing the selected MBT speed pool. Regenerating the
   assignments restores both tests without weakening their assertions. Assignment scores
   and membership changes remain visible; this is not a pure string replacement.

The existing stale firepower-input report was also regenerated. Its 770 changed-entry
count remains unchanged. The targeted report, identity, speed-grid and actor/map naming
checks pass together: 42 tests. A corrected full rerun is still required.

## Other checks

- 33 balance ledgers: zero drift.
- Canonical audits completed with eight failing categories: inherits, basebuilder_crates,
  buildable_order, packs, split_definitions, release_drift, doc_claims and doc_health.
  No empty Markdown report was generated. Failures are retained, not suppressed.
- Combined menu boot started 05:50:29 Jakarta and completed the 90-second observation:
  fresh menu-load evidence, no new exception logs, sampled memory peak 87.66%.
  The test process was closed. This proves loading only, not matchup balance.
- Corrected full rerun: 1,867 tests, 13 failures, 8 errors, 64 skips; sampled
  memory peak 77.25%, no guard stop. Failure signatures are the final PR341 baseline
  minus the now-repaired stale firepower report test, with no additional failures.
  Known baseline failures remain unresolved and visible; this is not a green suite.

No PR merge is authorized by this report. Naval source-role holds and factory-ready /
maximum-upgrade evidence remain distinct work items; no price or live unit-stat fitting
has been applied by the reference collection work.

## Subsequent 13-weapon name follow-up

The reviewed BTR80/Flak Truck/Monster Tank identity patch applied cleanly. A fresh
90-second combined menu boot started 06:29:54 Jakarta and passed: no exceptions,
fresh menu-load proof, peak memory 79.62%, process closed. All 13 resolved weapon
payloads are unchanged. The earlier 1,867-test result predates this additional patch;
a final combined source snapshot and full rerun remain pending.

## Latest source snapshot (06:50 Jakarta)

The integration index now additionally contains PR339 through `09ffb2108975bbd48e1d201158c9053b0b653874`
(including structured CA input and raw production declarations), PR340 through
`905e9befc698f522f6268d6aa7e6a2c4ef9d1d58` for source/tests, and the PR341
`0dba5542ff8068179066321ab1aa633a1a4cf82b` frozen-baseline test fix. The pending
merge parent/HEAD above remain the historical starting points, not these complete inputs.

Applying the new JSONL together with its new `.gitattributes` produced CRLF bytes in
this already-populated integration checkout. The strict reader correctly rejected the
SHA mismatch. A byte-normalized comparison proved line endings were the only difference;
the exact published source bytes were copied back and restaged. No hash expectation was
relaxed. Fresh assignment generation succeeds: 694 actors in scope, 362 assigned, 216
with at least two references; 68 chassis-only and 199 formula-only. These are diagnostic
assignments, not approved live stat changes. Firepower report remains 770 changed entries.

The two source PRs separately match their baseline failure signatures: PR339 1,710 tests,
14 failures, 8 errors, 64 skips; PR340 1,341 tests, 14 failures, 8 errors, 45 skips.
Combined canonical audits retain the same eight failing categories, with no empty
final reports. The full R3 suite completed: 1,892 tests, 13 failures, 8 errors and
64 skips; exact prior integration signatures, peak memory 78.38%, no guard stop.

## Final identical-definition cleanup validation

The two identical OrniBombC/OrniGunC Ordos declarations were removed in the PR341
follow-up and applied here. Both weapons still resolve from Atreides. All 2,900
combined resolved weapons compare identical before/after removal. Three focused
regressions pass. The targeted split-definition audit now passes: S2 4→2, S1 22,
unchanged ratchets 2/56. The earlier canonical report set predates this line-only
cleanup; the split-definition report was regenerated afterward.

Final full R4 suite: **1,895 tests, 13 failures, 8 errors, 64 skips**, exact same
failure/error signatures as R3. Peak memory **80.97%**, no guard stop. No new game
run or engine build was necessary for an exactly unchanged resolved weapon set.
The full suite is not green; the remaining baseline failures are not waived.

This final source cleanup is published in PR341 as `7823fb3e0`.
PR339 remains `09ffb2108`; PR340 remains `905e9befc`. All three are open drafts.
This local integration checkpoint is not pushed and does not merge any GitHub PR.

## Yak ownership checkpoint (08:33 Jakarta)

PR340 source/tests now match published `b45546fe165af74a21dec55685ed0cf8cdb47179`.
PR339 remains `09ffb2108` and PR341 `7823fb3e0`. Five aircraft own ten independent
guns in place of four shared names. Complete2,900→2,908 weapon comparison preserves
every retained and renamed concrete payload; only two abstract helpers additionally
appear. Raw and derived Soviet ledger values remain unchanged after identity and
direct-ancestry normalization. No extractor/class-policy change is included.

Seven focused regressions pass. Final R7 suite:1,902 tests,12 failures,8 errors,
64 skips; exact R6/R5 signatures, one stale inventory failure removed versus R4.
Peak RAM83.72%, no guard stop. All33 ledgers have zero drift. Final targeted
percentage-runtime, K-linearity, suffix, split, shape and balance-drift audits pass;
release-drift remains failing with raw D4=347 and unchanged335 threshold.

The07:45 90-second menu boot passed before final payload-preserving factoring,
not afterward. Independent review cleared the final compatibility-helper naming
and verified no hidden class change. Five additional informational missing-direct-
warhead-template entries are disclosed, not excused. The full suite is not green.
This remains local integration only, not a GitHub merge or master push.

## Tiger ownership checkpoint (08:54 Jakarta)

PR340 source/tests now include `d598557f93f6e9585d40789778153c00113040a5`.
The complete 2,908→2,911 combined weapon comparison passes; only the four expected
owner identities and one effect helper replace two shared names. Five new focused
tests pass. Final R8: 1,907 tests, 12 failures, 8 errors, 64 skips, exact R7
signatures; peak RAM85.88%. Both source/integration have33 zero-drift ledgers.
The08:49:30 90-second boot passed with no new exceptions, fresh menu proof and
peak RAM70.59%; this covers final Yak and Tiger changes, no rebuild or matchup test.
Targeted runtime/shape/split checks pass. Release D4 remains failing at348/335.
Local effect debt falls694→693; other shape buckets and stacked counts stay fixed.
Both follow-ups are independently reviewed, still draft and unmerged.

## Fourteen-name Allied checkpoint (09:18 Jakarta)

PR340 source/tests/map now include `243c95cd8a8694002860715ac4699f00dd3b4365`.
All 2,911 combined weapon payloads remain exact after the fourteen identities are
reversed. Eighteen Armament values, one muzzle-smoke binding and Survival's one
map-local pistol reference migrate. Six new tests and four projectile-speed tests
pass; archive member data, order and metadata are pinned. All ledger fields are
unchanged except identity strings, and both 33-ledger checks have zero drift.

Final R9: 1,913 tests, 12 failures, 8 errors, 64 skips; exact R8 signatures.
Peak RAM86.41%, no guard stop. Targeted runtime/shape/split checks pass; release
D4 remains failing at355/335, with all structural counts and D1/D2/D3 unchanged.
No additional game run is claimed after this identity-only batch. The Gunboat
geometry/heaviness hold is retained under its new cannon name, not marked resolved.

## Eleven-name checkpoint (09:51 Jakarta)

PR340 now includes `17022b1d5b73841df40daa5f6a2ef8c0d5170ce8`.
Eleven names and twelve Armament values migrate, with all 2,911 combined weapon
payloads and all numerical ledger fields preserved. The old Soviet SAM actor
regression now recognizes only the exact reviewed Nike identity substitution;
negative cases and the full weapon fixture keep gameplay changes detectable.

R11:1,919 tests,12 failures,8 errors,64 skips, exact R9 baseline signatures;
peak86.56%, no memory guard stop. Runtime/shape/split checks pass; release D4
remains failing at363/335, with other damage and structural counts unchanged.
Both33-ledger checks have zero drift. No post-batch game test is claimed.
PR340 remains draft and unmerged; this combined checkpoint is local only.
