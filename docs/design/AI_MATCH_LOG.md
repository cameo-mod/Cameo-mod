# AI match log — record schema v1

One JSON object per line (JSONL), **one line per bot player per finished match**.
Append-only. Never rewritten, never read back by the game.

File: `Platform.SupportDir` + `Logs/cameo-ai-matches.jsonl` (a single file across
matches and across releases; the batch harness may point elsewhere later via the
trait's `FileName` field).

Field order below is the required emission order (stable field order keeps diffs
and `sort`-based dedupe useful). All keys snake_case. All numbers integers.
Strings are the internal names, never the display/translated names.

## Field rules

- `record_id` — `game_uid + "|" + player.InternalName`. When `game_uid` is empty
  (skirmish without one), substitute a per-match `Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N")`
  generated ONCE per world by the world-level writer and shared by all lines of
  that match, so lines of one match always share a prefix.
- `outcome` — lowercase `won` / `lost` / `undecided`. `undecided` covers
  `WinState.Undefined` (game ended without a resolution, e.g. host quit).
  Emit the record anyway; the aggregator drops undecided rows.
- `personality` — the personality condition enabled at the END of the match,
  with the `personality-` prefix stripped (`personality-rush` -> `rush`).
  `""` if none was ever enabled (a non-personality bot).
- `personality_timeline` — every observed change, oldest first, including the
  initial grant; `tick` is `world.WorldTick` at the change. Cap the list at 64
  entries (drop the middle, keep first 32 and last 32) so a future oscillating
  manager cannot produce unbounded lines. `personality_switches` is the TOTAL
  number of changes observed after the first grant, uncapped, so a truncated
  timeline is still detectable.
- `stats` — from `PlayerStatistics` on that player, plus `PlayerResources`
  (`Earned`/`Spent`) for `resources_earned`/`resources_spent`; `0` when the
  trait is absent.
- `opponents` / `allies` — every non-neutral, non-spectating player other than
  the subject, split by `player.IsAlliedWith`. Same key order as shown.
- `handicap` and `bot_type` are recorded because they are the cheat axes: an
  aggregation that mixes handicaps or difficulty tiers is meaningless.
- Ordering: `opponents` and `allies` sorted by `name` ordinal, so two records of
  the same match are byte-comparable.

## Writer rules

- Write ONLY when `world.Type == WorldType.Regular`, `!world.IsReplay`, and
  `Game.IsHost` (bots only tick on the host — `Player.cs:223` — so the host is
  the only process with authority, and this prevents every client in a
  multiplayer game appending a duplicate line).
- Write once per match, at the first of: `IGameOver.GameOver`, or all bot
  players resolved via `INotifyWinStateChanged`. Guard with a `written` flag.
- Append under a cross-process named mutex derived from the canonical file path,
  exactly as `CameoCareerRepository` does (`SHA256` of the upper-cased full path
  on Windows), because the future AI-vs-AI harness runs many instances at once.
  Timeout 100 ms; on timeout retry on a later tick with the same backoff shape
  as `CameoCareerRecorder.TryPersist` (`1 << min(retry-1, 5)`, capped 30 ticks),
  and give up silently after 8 attempts — a missing log line must never affect
  a match.
- One `File.AppendAllText` of all lines for the match, each line terminated with
  `"\n"` (not `Environment.NewLine`), UTF-8 no BOM. Serialize by hand
  (`StringBuilder`) with `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`; escape `\`, `"` and
  control characters in every string value. Do not add a JSON dependency.
- Never read the file, never let its contents influence the simulation, and
  never touch synced state. This is record-only.

## Emitter guard — hand-serialized JSON has a separator bug class

Serializing by hand means one forgotten comma makes every line unparseable, and
the aggregator can only report that as a skip — it cannot say *why*. The first
implementation shipped with exactly that: `AppendTimeline` wrote no leading
comma, so every line came out as

    ..."personality_switches":0"personality_timeline":[]...

`tools/tests/test_aggregate_ai_matches.py` could not see it, because its
fixtures are built with `json.dumps` — it tests the reader, never the writer.

Two rules follow, and both are load-bearing:

- **Every `Append*` helper writes its own leading separator**, governed by the
  same `first` flag — `AppendString`, `AppendNumber`, `AppendBoolean`,
  `AppendObjectPropertyStart`, `AppendTimeline` and `AppendRelationships` alike.
  `BuildLog` therefore contains no hand-written `,` at all. A new field cannot
  be added without its separator because there is nowhere to omit it from.
- **`OpenRA.Mods.Cameo.Test/AiMatchLogWriterTest.cs` runs that same call
  sequence and parses the result** with `JsonDocument`. It fails 2 of 3 against
  the original emitter. Extend it whenever `BuildLog` grows a field.

## Situation snapshot log (schema 1)

Phase 2 adds a second record type to the same record-only logging boundary.
`MasterAiBotModule` publishes an unsynced, host-local snapshot and does not
queue orders, grant conditions, mutate synced state, or read either log back.
The snapshot is intentionally **pre-fog**: it scans `world.Actors` without
shroud gating. Future fogged observation is a later phase.

The situation writer emits one line per snapshot rebuild per bot player. Field
order is stable and all numeric values are integers:

```json
{"schema":1,"kind":"situation","record_id":"<game_uid>|<player>|<tick>","game_uid":"","map_uid":"...","player":"Multi0","faction":"td_gdi","bot_type":"medium","tick":1500,"urgency":"normal","personality_current":"rush","personality_candidate":"steamroller","main_target":"Multi1","main_target_score":730,"hints":{"defence_fraction":35,"expansion_appetite":20},"demand":{"anti_air":10,"anti_armour":40,"anti_infantry":25,"detector":0,"artillery":60},"own":{"army_value":5400,"defence_value":1200,"buildings":14,"harvesters":4,"kills_cost_window":900,"deaths_cost_window":1500},"enemies":[{"name":"Multi1","faction":"td_nod","alive":true,"army_value":8100,"infantry_value":2000,"vehicle_value":5000,"air_value":1100,"naval_value":0,"defence_count":7,"defence_value":3500,"tech_buildings":4,"production_buildings":3,"expansion_clusters":2,"harvesters":5,"refineries":2,"pressure_value":800,"stealth_share":10,"nearest_cells":42,"last_seen_tick":1500,"score":730}]}
```

`urgency` is `normal`, `pressured`, or `emergency`; `main_target` is empty
when there is no candidate. Enemy records are sorted by ordinal player name.
Candidate personality and target values are observations only. The phase-2
target score deliberately has no pairwise-damage (`w_hurt`) term because no
usable attribution hook exists; that term is phase-4 work.
