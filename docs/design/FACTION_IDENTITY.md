# Faction Identity & Balance Bias

**Purpose.** This is the binding reference for *how each faction's units differ within a
class*. The per-class formula (`FORMULA_V2.md`) fixes each unit's **cost** and holds
**Δ≤1**; this document decides the *direction* of the leftover uniqueness budget so
differentiation is **lore-directed**, not arbitrary. Source-game research is cited; the
lore compendium is `../FACTIONS.md` (this doc is the balance interpretation of it).

## Core principle

Within a class, cost is pinned and price must stay Δ≤1. Because the price is fixed,
raising one stat forces another down — so each faction spends its budget on the stat
its source-game identity leans into, and pays for it in the opposite stat.

**Primary axis (confirmed across every source game): HP ↔ Speed.**
- **Brute / Heavy / Turtle** factions → **+HP, +Damage, −Speed** (tanky, hard-hitting, slow; in the original games also more expensive / fewer units — here that becomes stat weight since cost is pinned).
- **Rush / Mobile / Stealth / Swarm** factions → **+Speed, −HP** (fast, fragile; cheaper/more numerous in-game → here they trade raw durability for reach/speed).

**Secondary axes:**
- **Tech / Power** factions → **+Damage, +Range** (elite units; Protoss/Steel-Consortium "shields" read as +HP).
- **Special mechanic** (not a stat bias — a per-unit trait, priced via the special-K multiplier): stealth, mind-control, self-heal, decoys, transforming, cyborg turn-rate, area-denial.

**⚠️ Per-TYPE, not global (maintainer 2026-07-25).** A faction's lean can INVERT between
unit types. From the source stats (`ORIGINAL_UNIT_STATS.md`): RA2 **Soviet infantry is
frail** while Soviet *tanks* are the tankiest+slowest; **Allied infantry is tanky+slow**
while Allied *tanks* are weak+fast; StarCraft **Terran infantry is frail** while its
*vehicles* are tanky. **So the bias tables below are the INFANTRY leans** — vehicle and
aircraft leans are derived separately (from the matrix) in those passes. And a unit's
balance class always follows its in-game TEMPLATE (`LineBreaker` = vehicle, etc.), never
an HP guess.

**NO mirror factions (Cameo departs from Warcraft 2 here).** In the original WC2, Humans
and Orcs are stat-mirrors. Cameo deliberately does **not** do this — mirror factions are
dull. We follow the **Warcraft 3 philosophy**: every faction, and every individual unit,
gets its own distinct stats (**no two units may share a stat value** — the uniqueness law,
see `../DESIGN.md`). So WC2 Humans and Orcs are differentiated like any other pair, and
their counterpart units (Footman vs Grunt, Knight vs Ogre, …) are re-statted apart, never
mirrored: Humans lean **defensive / versatile / support-magic**, Orcs lean **aggressive /
brute**.

## Faction bias table

Legend: **HP** / **SPD** / **DMG** / **RNG** columns are the lean (＋ high, − low, ・ neutral).
"Special" is the signature mechanic (priced separately, not a stat lean).

### Tiberium (C&C: Tiberian Dawn / Tiberian Sun)

| Faction | Playstyle | HP | SPD | DMG | RNG | Special / signature |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| GDI TD | Brute Force / Heavy Armor | ＋ | − | ＋ | ・ | Air power, strong defense; Mammoth/Orca/Commando. Expensive, few, slow. |
| Nod TD | Rush / Stealth / Guerrilla | − | ＋ | ・ | ・ | Stealth, cheap & numerous, better AA, nuke; harassment. |

### Red Alert 1 (+ Cameo's Japan)

| Faction | Playstyle | HP | SPD | DMG | RNG | Special / signature |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| Allies RA1 | Tech / Mobility / Naval | − | ＋ | ・ | ＋ | Faster-weaker tanks; naval (Cruiser long-range); Chronosphere. Weak ground defense. |
| Soviets RA1 | Brute Force | ＋ | − | ＋ | ・ | Durable/slow/expensive vehicles; Tesla; Iron Curtain; heavy air. |
| Japan RA1 | Rush / Mobility | − | ＋ | ・ | ・ | **Samurai melee (one-slash)**, imperial discipline, speed/flexibility. |

### Red Alert 2 / Yuri

### Warcraft 2 — distinct stats (WC3 approach, NOT mirrored)

Original WC2 mirrors Human/Orc; Cameo re-stats them apart. Counterpart units
(Footman↔Grunt, Knight↔Ogre, …) must NOT share stats — split them along this lean:

| Faction | Playstyle | HP | SPD | DMG | RNG | Special / signature |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| Humans WC2 | Defensive / Versatile / Magic | ・ | ・ | ・ | ＋ | Healing (Paladin/Mage), towers, tech; methodical, longer reach. |
| Orcs WC2 | Aggressive / Brute | ＋ | ・ | ＋ | − | Bloodlust + Raise Dead; high-HP grunts, raw offensive power. |

### Outpost 2

| Faction | Playstyle | HP | SPD | DMG | RNG | Special / signature |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| Eden | Colony / Tech Rush | ＋ | − | ＋ | ・ | Better tech, brute-force military, defense-oriented. |
| Plymouth | Colony / Area Denial | − | ＋ | ・ | ・ | Speed & trickery, stolen/improvised tech, Action Bomb, area denial. |

### RA2-Mod factions (Cameo-original / obscure — from `FACTIONS.md`; deeper source research pending)

| Faction | Playstyle (FACTIONS.md) | HP | SPD | DMG | RNG | Special / signature |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| Asian Alliance | Mass Horde / Cheap / Superweapons | − | − | − | ・ | ← **Eagle Red + Generals China**: cheap, numerous, **SLOW** infantry (horde bonus), weak individually, but devastating superweapons/nuclear. (corrected from +SPD 2026-07-25.) |
| Steel Consortium | Tech / Shields / Long-range defense | ＋ | − | ＋ | ＋ | ← **Foehn Revolt (Mental Omega) Last Bastion**: durable + **long-range area-denial** + defensive; nano-upgrades that swap roles; shields = +HP. |
| Latin Syndicate | Turtle / Artillery / Explosives | ＋ | − | ＋ | ＋ | ← maintainer: **turtle masters** (bunker), **best artillery + huge explosive power**; black-market Soviet surplus. (corrected from −HP/+SPD 2026-07-25.) |
| Naxis | Turtle / Heavy Armor | ＋＋ | −− | ＋ | ・ | **WW2 parody**; very tanky, slow; undead-revival superweapon. |
| Schwarzer Mond | Timing / Anti-gravity | ・ | ＋ | ＋ | ・ | ← **Iron Sky moon-Nazis**: anti-gravity → hover/flying units + saucers (aircraft); sci-fi tech; timing/burst spike; Götterdämmerung superweapon. |
| FutureTech | Tech Rush / Robotics | ＋ | − | ＋ | ＋ | **Droids = vehicle turn-rate (speed ×5)**; robotic, high-tech. |
| TKM | Modular (WIP) | ・ | ・ | ・ | ・ | Modular units — flagged WIP; treat as neutral until designed. |

## How this feeds the converter (implementation note)

The converter (`propose_class_rebalance.py`) currently makes stats unique by arbitrary
nudging. The next step is to bias the uniqueness step by the acting unit's faction lean
above: e.g. in the scout class, GDI/Soviet/Naxis scouts take the high-HP/low-speed end
of the spread, Nod/Ordos/Zerg scouts the high-speed/low-HP end — all still Δ≤1, all still
5-stat unique. Mirror factions (WC2) keep their counterpart's stats and differ only in
the special. This keeps every unit unique **and** lore-true.
