"""Score bot team coordination from match telemetry (TC-3 acceptance metrics).

Reads the per-match records a team run leaves in a support dir
(tools/ai/run_ai_match_batch.py --team-size N):

    Logs/cameo-ai-missions.jsonl   one line per mission event/attempt
    Logs/cameo-ai-matches.jsonl    one record per bot per match (allies list)
    batch_results.jsonl            one record per executed match

and reports, per team and per match, the §12.18 acceptance metrics:

    shared_push       windows where >=2 teammates committed attack attempts
                      (raid/recon/secure) against the SAME enemy player —
                      the coalition-main-target effect. raid:* comes from
                      taken provider cards; secure:<player> is emitted when a
                      cardless Rush wave commits against the named enemy
                      (mission target or main-target steering).
    contested_claims  same exclusive-claim `mission_id` with genuinely
                      overlapping open attempts by >=2 teammates — a real race
                      for one capturable. A release-then-recommit is succession
                      (claim timeouts legitimately reopen finished targets);
                      arbitration resolves overlaps via superseded stand-downs.
    defend_answers    defend_kind mission attempts (COMMITTED only). Three
                      sources: `defend:self:rN` = own-base Defend BotMission
                      provider cards; `defend_answer:<requesterKey>:<cell>` =
                      TC-2b/TC-3 ally answers through the protection-squad
                      path — requesterKey is the participant's InternalName
                      (or #ClientIndex), the cell its defended position —
                      direct attribution, not proximity; and
                      `assist_answer:<requesterKey>:<cell>` = the TC-3 assist
                      election's escort answer to a contested expansion claim,
                      same channel, strictly below a defend answer.
    coverage          distinct target players / regions touched per team.

Team membership is inferred from cameo-ai-matches.jsonl `allies` records
(transitive closure of ally names). `--team A=Multi0,Multi1` overrides.
