"""Run repeated headless AI-vs-AI matches and harvest match-log records.

This is the Stage D data tap of the AI architecture: the schema-2 records in
cameo-ai-matches.jsonl only become useful at volume, and volume needs a
harness — a script and a map rotation, not engine work.

Each matchup is a (faction x bot) vs (faction x bot) pairing on a generated
variant of the duel map. Per the 2026-09-28 maintainer ruling, the default
map is the shipped tournament map "A Nuclear Winter"
(mods/cameo/maps/_ra_a-nuclear-winter.oramap): the harness extracts it into
the support dir, adds the NonCombatant referee seat for the local client,
converts Multi0/Multi1 into map-side bot players (Playable: False + Bot: +
HomeLocation taken from the map's mpspawn actors), and cross-wires their
Enemies. --map can point at the legacy ai_duel_gate_20260928 template dir for
the old generated-fixture behavior.

The variant's map.yaml gets its two duelists patched (Bot/Faction) and their
starting forces written into the Actors: section — headless Launch.Map runs
a Local server, so no lobby bot seating exists and the duelists are map-side
players (Playable: False + Bot:), which SpawnStartingUnits cannot serve; the
harness therefore resolves each faction's StartingUnits group from the mod
yaml and pre-places it.

The local client occupies the map's declared-NonCombatant "Referee" slot —
lobby clients ignore PlayerReference.NonCombatant, so the match writer checks
the declared flag and keeps it out of every bot's opponents/allies. The
referee's "empty" start class loses its conquest objective on the first tick,
so it never blocks game-over. Launch.Benchmark exits the process on GameOver;
ConquestVictoryConditions decides on elimination and the map's locked
TimeLimitManager is the stalemate failsafe (a timed-out duel records both
bots "lost" — an honest draw, not an engine-invented winner).

--team-size N turns each side into an N-player team (2v2+): --bot-a/--bot-b take a
comma-separated bot type per seat (a single name duplicates across both
slots) and the default map becomes the shipped doubles map
mods/cameo/maps/_ra_doubles.oramap, whose consecutive Multi pairs are the
teams (Multi0+Multi1 vs Multi2+Multi3). The engine resolves map-side stances
per ORDERED pair, so each member declares its teammate in Allies: and BOTH
enemy refs in Enemies: (the map's own Creeps hostility is preserved). A 2v2
match appends four schema-2 records sharing one game_uid; the team verdict
is "any member record won" — a teammate eliminated early still records lost.

The fixture locks `gamespeed` to `maximum` (1 ms timestep): bot tests run
uncapped at whatever tick rate the CPU sustains, so decisive matches resolve
many times sooner in wall time. At maximum one in-game minute is 60,000 ticks,
so the fixture offers TimeLimitOptions 0/1/2/3/4/6/9 (tick for tick the
insane-era 0/10/20/30/40/60/90) and the default is 3 = 180,000 ticks: the
ENGINE ends a stalemate at that depth and the match is recorded (both sides
`lost`: a timed-out stalemate has no winner),
where a 30-minute cap (1.8M ticks) left the harness to kill it with no record.
The stall detector
(debug.log goes quiet after its first write this run — arming skips the load
phase) kills hung matches in ~2 minutes while a generous wall bound protects
slow-but-live ones. Run
bot batches serially and prefer an idle machine for consistent timings.

On a shared box a bigger hazard is external kills: another agent's
taskkill/Stop-Process sweep terminates every OpenRA.exe by name, which
surfaces as a bare "exit=N" mid-match — no exception log, no appended
records. Those matches get one automatic retry (--retries); real crashes
write exception-*.log and are never retried. Per-match results also append
to <support>/batch_results.jsonl as they land, so a batch whose driver is
itself swept still leaves usable evidence.

The batch fingerprints its arms once at start (LC7): the mod commit and its
dirty state, the engine VERSION, a sha256 over engine/bin/OpenRA*.dll, a
sha256 over the resolved AI yaml set (mods/**/ai.yaml + mods/**/ai/*.yaml),
the map source, and the batch spec. The fingerprint is recomputed before
every match attempt and any drift aborts the batch — a mid-batch checkout or
rebuild (the auto-sync service landing new yaml under stale DLLs killed
league-3 this way) silently changes the A/B arms otherwise.
--allow-fingerprint-drift records the drift and keeps running.

Usage:
    python tools/ai/run_ai_match_batch.py [options]

    --factions td_gdi,td_nod        factions for the matrix (default: td_gdi,td_nod)
    --bot-a hard --bot-b classic   bot types per side (default: hard — the Frankenstein
                                    candidate — vs the omniscient classic reference bot)
    --repeats 4                     matches per matchup (spawn sides alternate)
    --swap-bots                     also alternate which bot takes which spawn —
                                    the A/B acceptance requires both spawns
    --team-size 2 --bot-a hard,hard --bot-b classic,classic
                                    2v2: one bot type per team slot (a single
                                    name duplicates); teams seat on consecutive
                                    Multi pairs (default map _ra_doubles.oramap)
    --map PATH                      duel map (default: _ra_a-nuclear-winter.oramap)
    --time-limit 30                 per-match cap in minutes (engine options only)
    --support-dir PATH              batch support dir (default: %TEMP%/ai-match-batch-<ts>)
    --dry-run                       print the matrix + variants, launch nothing
    --allow-fingerprint-drift       log mid-batch arm changes and continue
                                    (default: abort — a changed arm voids the A/B)

Exit codes: 0 = batch complete, 2 = no usable records collected, 1 = failure.
