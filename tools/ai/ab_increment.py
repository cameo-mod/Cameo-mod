"""Increment A/B driver — one command runs the whole three-arm mirror-match experiment.

AI_MASTER_PLAN §1.2 step 6 (amended 2026-10-01): an increment lands on master behind
behaviour switches, then ONE A/B decides whether the switches stay. This driver is that
A/B. It freezes each arm in its own `git worktree`, applies the increment's switches
in-tree via tools/ai/apply_increment_switches.py (uncommitted edits — the design is that
master keeps the defaults until the A/B says otherwise), then runs mirror shards through
the arm's OWN run_ai_match_batch.py copy.

Arms:
    ctrl — --ctrl commit, no switches (the previous-master baseline)
    half — --cand commit + `--groups A_squad_tactics`  (override: --half-groups)
    all  — --cand commit + `--groups all`              (override: --groups)
--arms ctrl,all selects a subset (default: all three).

MIRROR-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION (maintainer ruling 2026-10-01): cross-faction matches measure
faction balance, not the bot, so each arm runs its factions as SEPARATE shard batches —
`--factions td_gdi` and `--factions td_nod` in two invocations, NEVER the combined
`--factions td_gdi,td_nod` (which adds the cross pairing). enforce_single_faction() is
the belt: shard argv cannot carry a comma.

Each shard:
    python <tree>/tools/ai/run_ai_match_batch.py --factions <one> --bot-a hard
        --bot-b classic --repeats 8 --swap-bots --time-limit 3
        --support-dir <out>/<arm>_<faction>
with cwd = the arm's frozen tree. The runner resolves REPO_ROOT, mods/ and ./engine from
its own location, so invoking the TREE'S copy is what actually freezes the arm — tools/ai
is itself part of the batch fingerprint. 8 repeats x 2 factions = 16 matches per arm.

Frozen trees: `git worktree add --detach <out>/trees/<arm> <commit>`, then (switch arms)
the applier from THIS checkout — it reads THIS repo's increment_switches.yaml, which is
the spec the A/B was ordered under; the tree's own copy may be older. Engine: copy
engine/ from --engine-donor (a checkout with a built engine; the dir itself or its
parent both accepted), else `make.cmd all` in the tree; then always
`dotnet build CameoMod.sln -c Release --nologo -p:TargetPlatform=win-x64` with
DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD=LatestMajor so the mod DLLs match the tree's C#. --skip-build reuses
already-prepared trees (switches are still re-applied — the applier is idempotent).

Capacity: at most --max-instances OpenRA.exe MACHINE-WIDE — the fleet shares the box, so
foreign matches count too. Each shard's batch runner is internally sequential (one game
instance per shard). A just-launched shard's OpenRA.exe takes a while to appear in
tasklist (variant write + mod load); launches are credited for --spawn-grace seconds so a
burst cannot overshoot the cap before the new processes become visible.

Phases:
  1. provision the arm trees (worktree add, switches, engine, dotnet build)
  2. --smoke: ONE match per arm first (repeats=1, first faction, own support dir under
     <out>/smoke/ so its different batch fingerprint can never pool into arm data).
     Verified: match records in Logs/cameo-ai-matches.jsonl AND a fingerprint in
     batch_results.jsonl; a dead/timed-out smoke aborts that arm loudly.
  3. full shards under the instance cap
  4. pooled readout: ab_summary.py per arm + <out>/increment_summary.json

Early stop: every --poll-seconds the driver re-tallies each arm's `hard` (bot-a) wins
from its shards' batch_results.jsonl (one row per consumed matchup — retried/aborted
attempts included, they still burn a planned match). A pair is decided when the trailer
cannot reach the leader even by winning every match it can still play
(`trailing_won + remaining < leading_won`; equality — a possible tie — keeps it live).
Then a subtlety the plain reading misses: with three arms, killing a decided pair's
shards would FREEZE the other pairs those arms still feed, biasing them. So an arm's
remaining shards are terminated only once EVERY pair touching it is decided — that is
the moment its data can no longer change any verdict. Decisions land in the run summary
as "early_stop" entries.

Usage:
    python tools/ai/ab_increment.py --ctrl <sha> --cand <sha> --groups all --out C:/tmp/inc2ab-x
    python tools/ai/ab_increment.py --ctrl <sha> --cand <sha> --out ... \
        --arms ctrl,all --smoke --engine-donor C:/path/to/built/checkout --dry-run
