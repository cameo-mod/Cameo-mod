"""Round-trip check of the AI learning loop (DESIGN 19.2, AI_MASTER_PLAN): did every layer leave evidence?

Reads one or more batch support dirs (each has Logs/ with debug.log, cameo-ai-matches.jsonl,
cameo-ai-missions.jsonl, cameo-ai-situations.jsonl) and prints one PASS/WARN/FAIL row per layer with the
evidence count: load, perception, missions, ownership, order gate, outcomes, execution, write-back, fog, learning, tools.
Exit 1 on any FAIL. A genericbot player is any player whose bot_type is not a reference bot (classic, classic_hard).

Usage:
    python tools/ai/round_trip_check.py <support-dir> [<support-dir> ...]

Perception note: BotSituation writes no debug line, so the master AI's snapshots are counted from the
situation archive (cameo-ai-situations.jsonl), which AiSituationLogWriter fills from the same snapshots.
