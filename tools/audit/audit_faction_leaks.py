"""audit_faction_leaks.py — B1 detector (cross-faction actor leaks).

For every real faction, computes the reachable buildable set (prerequisite
closure, incl. support-power-produced actors) and flags:
  L1 buildable whose attributed owner is a DIFFERENT faction (leak)
  L2 buildable defined in another faction's ContentPack folder
  L3 buildable inheriting from a concrete actor owned by another faction
     (the tsntsamcabal / Slave-Miner bug shape)
Shared/unattributed actors are listed once as "needs human decision".
