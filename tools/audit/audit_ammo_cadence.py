"""audit_ammo_cadence.py — an AMMO POOL makes `ReloadDelay` the wrong clock, and every carrier
slave must have a pool, an explicit ammo-dependent firing gate, and a reload policy.

MAINTAINER RULINGS, 2026-09-12:
  * "the SSM launcher reload delay in cameo doesn't matter since it requires ammo to shoot
     which regenerates on the actor itself"
  * "our helicopters ... are designed to shoot for 5 seconds at full speed and then after that
     at half speed" / "we take into account how much damage they can deal from full to empty
     ammo pool and in what time and calculate that as the DPS"
  * "For planes that need to reload on the airfield ... reload delay means nothing there so we
     only compare the maximum damage per sortie"
  * "All carrier slaves must have an ammo pool and reload, so what you have discovered with the
     A10 carrier is a real bug"

A1  cadence regime census. `ammo_cadence.cadence()` classifies each ammo-pool actor and says
    what the comparable figure actually is. The ledger publishes ONE number for everybody —
    `damage x burst / (reload + burst delays)` — and nothing in `extract_stats`,
    `reference_distribution` or `formula` mentions `AmmoPool`, so for every actor counted here
    the published DPS is measuring a cadence the unit does not have.

A2  CARRIER SLAVES. Every `CarrierSlave` must carry an `AmmoPool` and a reload trait. The two
    failure modes are OPPOSITE and both are live:

      * NO POOL AT ALL -> the engine grants UNLIMITED AMMO. `CarrierSlave.cs:59-65`:
            if (ammoPools.Length == 0)
                return false;   // "The unit may not have ammo but will have unlimited ammunitions."
        so the slave never expends, never needs to dock, and the carrier's launch/expend/return
        cycle never runs. It is a permanent free attacker.

      * POOL BUT NO RELOAD -> the slave has no explicit in-flight reload policy. The carrier
        engine refills every pool when a slave re-enters its carrier; the reload trait is the
        separate policy for recovery while the slave is deployed.

      * POOL WITHOUT A FIRING GATE -> `AmmoPool` spends ammo from its attack notification after
        the attack is selected, so a newly added pool alone does not stop an empty slave from
        firing. `AmmoCondition` plus `AttackAircraft.RequiresCondition` (and armament pause
        gates where needed) is required.

⚠ READ BOTH RELOAD TRAIT SPELLINGS. `ReloadAmmoPool` (92 actors) and `ReloadAmmoPoolCA` (25)
are both in use. The first version of this measurement read only the former and misclassified
25 actors — the same one-spelling mistake that hid burst delays behind `BurstDelay0..8` and the
DTA `$Inherits` directive behind a regex. When a trait has a CA twin, match the STEM.

Ratchets are LOWER-ONLY, as everywhere else.
