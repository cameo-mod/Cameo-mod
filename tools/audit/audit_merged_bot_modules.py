"""Merged bot modules stay current with their parents (DESIGN §19.3).

A merged module (e.g. `BaseRepairBotModule` = OpenRA `BuildingRepairBotModule` + CA
`BuildingRepairBotModuleCA`) is a SEPARATE file: an upstream fix to a parent lands in the parent's
copy (CA via `ca_vendor_sync.py`, OpenRA/AS via the engine pin) and never reaches the merge by itself.
The parents stay in the tree verbatim (`classic` still runs them), so their content is the signal.

`merged_bot_modules.json` records, per merged module, each parent file and the hash of its content at
the time of the merge. When a parent's hash changes, this audit FAILS until someone ports the change
into the merged module (or rules it irrelevant) and re-baselines:

  python tools/audit/audit_merged_bot_modules.py            # check
  python tools/audit/audit_merged_bot_modules.py --write    # after porting: record today's parents

Hashes ignore line endings, so a checkout's CRLF/LF setting cannot trip it. A parent under `engine/`
is missing in a tree without a built engine: it is reported UNVERIFIED (the run says how many were
checked), never counted as a pass.
