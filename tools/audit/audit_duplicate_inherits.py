"""audit_duplicate_inherits.py — detect actors/templates that inherit the same
parent through more than one Inherits@ path.

The engine merges inherited subtrees by key. When the same parent is reached via
two different Inherits@ lines, its children can be merged twice, leading to
order-dependent overrides or, in the worst case, a boot-time YAML parse crash.

This is especially dangerous when adding a parent to a base template: the
children that already inherited that parent through another base now get it
from two paths. Grepping `Inherits:` cannot see it because the collision only
appears after resolution.

# ── THE BLOCKING CLASS, SIMULATED THE WAY THE ENGINE ACTUALLY DOES IT ─────────
# `audit()` above reports every parent reached by more than one path. Most of those
# are DIAMONDS through sibling branches, which boot fine, so the report was advisory
# and `main()` always returned 0. Two things made that insufficient on 2026-09-12:
#
#   1. it walked ACTORS ONLY. Weapons are a separate namespace and the crash class is
#      identical there. Current master `b235c698` ships one blocking weapon and this
#      audit exited 0 on it; the game did not reach the menu.
#   2. "reached twice" is not the engine's rule, so it could not be gated.
#
# MiniYaml.cs:463-476 is the rule. Resolving a node, `inherited` accumulates each
# DIRECT parent at that level and is threaded DOWN into each parent's own resolution;
# a sibling's subtree does NOT contribute back. So the error fires exactly when one
# name appears twice along a single ROOT-TO-ANCESTOR PATH — which is why a diamond
# through two siblings is legal and a direct-plus-inherited repeat is not.
#
# `-` overrides are irrelevant here: the throw happens during inherit expansion,
# before any removal is applied.
