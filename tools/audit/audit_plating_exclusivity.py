"""audit_plating_exclusivity.py — no actor may ever wear two armor platings at once.

Maintainer, 2026-08-16: *"armor platings MUST be mutually exclusive like they
currently are for RA2 but team upgrades should still be able to add extra armor on
top which just increases the armor total amount but not the armor type!"*

Two rules, and this file checks both:

  **X1 — TWO PLATINGS MUST BE GATED APART.** A plating REPLACES the class armor
  (`AreaDamageWarhead.DamageVersus` selects it), so two ACTIVE platings mean two candidate
  rows for one hit. The C# takes the most protective, which is safe but is a BACKSTOP, not
  a design.

  ⚠ **Carrying two plating TRAITS is normal and correct** — that was the first version of
  this check and it was wrong. 32 actors carry both Soviet doctrine platings, or both
  Allied ones, precisely so the unit benefits from whichever branch the player picked. What
  must be impossible is both CONDITIONS being true, and RA2 enforces that with
  `ProductionIconMutualExclusion: Group` plus a `!<sibling>` prerequisite on each branch.

  So the real test is: every plating an actor can reach must come from an upgrade sharing
  one exclusion GROUP. Two platings from different groups (or from an upgrade with no group
  at all) can stack, and then the tie-break silently decides the matchup.

  **X2 — A PLATING IS A TYPE, NOT AN AMOUNT.** An upgrade that grants a plating must not
  also carry a large flat `DamageMultiplier`: the two compound (`0.85 x 0.70 = 0.595`, a
  40% cut where the branch intended 15%). Team/tech upgrades are the opposite case and
  are FINE — they carry a multiplier and no armor type, which is exactly the maintainer's
  "adds the amount, not the type".
