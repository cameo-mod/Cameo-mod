"""Engine-strict orphan-cancel check: every `-Key:` must have a provider.

OpenRA's MiniYaml.ResolveInherits (engine/OpenRA.Game/MiniYaml.cs) throws
"There are no elements with key `X` to remove" when a `-X:` cancel has no
matching node in the accumulated merge — that aborts ruleset load at boot.
The python resolver's _merge_into silently skips the same cancel, so a
strip/refactor can pass every resolve-diff and still crash the real game.
Found 2026-09-23 (W23 batch): a child weapon's `-Warhead@GrenadeFriendlyFire`
was legal while its parent's `^Grenade` supplied the node; stripping the
template made the cancel an orphan and the boot died mid-load. Nested
cancels (`-LaunchAngle:` inside `Projectile:`) hit the same rule.

Check: at each tree level the provider set is the union of every resolved
parent's children keys at that path, plus this node's own non-cancel
children *earlier in document order* (the engine merges inherited nodes
first, then applies own children in order). A `-Key` whose target is not
in that set is an orphan. `Inherits` keys are not cancelable.

Exit 1 when orphans exist (boot would crash); 0 when clean.

`--fragile` additionally reports cancels whose sole provider is ONE parent
inherit edge (report-only, exit unchanged): dropping that edge orphans the
cancel, which is the W2 dead-edge sweep failure mode — a `-X:` is a CONSUMER
of its provider edge, so "nodes absent from resolved output" does not make
the edge dead. Run before any edge-deletion sweep; deleting a provider edge
must carry its cancels with it (or leave both).
