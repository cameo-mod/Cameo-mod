"""audit_versus_profile.py — guard DESIGN §12.0h / §12.0c / §12.0d on the LIVE profiles.

    python tools/audit/audit_versus_profile.py

Three binding maintainer rulings had NO guard at all — only `gen_weapon_template.py` implemented
them, so nothing checked that what the generator intends is what the tree actually carries:

  §12.0h  THE MEAN-100 LAW (2026-08-16) — every family's MAIN warhead has its 16 armor rows
          normalised to MEAN 100. This is what makes `K` SHAPE-ONLY and `Damage` the
          sole magnitude knob, so a drifted mean is a HIDDEN price multiplier.
          ⭐ R16 (maintainer, 2026-09-24): the binding measure is now the GEOMETRIC mean —
          *"All versus values of a warhead must always have a geometric mean of 100%"*.
          Geometric is the correct centre for multipliers (a 200/50 pair centres at 100
          geometrically but 125 arithmetically); §12.0j already ruled the regeneration
          normalises geometrically, and R16 makes it the checked law NOW. The arithmetic
          mean is still reported alongside as a drift signal, not a law.
  §12.0d  THE CLASS TILT — each LEVEL tilts toward one end of every armor ladder, and
          *"the tilt MUST NEVER reorder a ladder ... it can never invert"*.
          ⚠ The guarantee is WITHIN a ladder. `None` is INF and `Superheavy` is VEH, so
          comparing them is a CROSS-ladder relation the tilt is DESIGNED to change — a Light
          tilt deliberately raises infantry relative to superheavy vehicles. A first version
          of this audit compared None vs Superheavy and reported 4 families "inverting"; that
          was a false positive. The real invariant is direction WITHIN each ladder.
  spread  R16 (maintainer, 2026-09-24): HARD BOUND 2x–20x (the Versus range itself is
          10%–200%), with the roster's spread distribution a bell curve PEAKING AT 4x–5x —
          2x (super-generalist) and 20x (super-specialist) are the low-occupancy asymptotes,
          legal only as deliberate exceptions. Supersedes R5's 2x–8x band.

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS — AND WHY IT READS THROUGH THE RESOLVER, NEVER A HAND PARSER.

On 2026-08-22 I measured these laws with a bespoke yaml parser and got every number wrong. The
parser never CLOSED the `Versus:` block, so the `PercentageVersus:` rows that the AreaDamage fold
added inside the SAME warhead node silently overwrote the profile:

    Warhead@Bullet_Light: AreaDamage
        Versus:            None: 200 ... Superheavy 48   <- the real profile
        PercentageVersus:  None: 16  ... Superheavy  1   <- what the parser read

I reported "0 of 125 conform" and "every family violates the spread band". The truth was 123 of
125 and 37 of 42. Every downstream figure — means, spreads, ratios, inversion counts — was
internally consistent and wrong. This audit therefore uses `miniyaml.Ruleset.resolve_weapon` and
`weapon_efficiency.versus_of`, the project's own readers, which cannot make that mistake.

EXIT CODE: 1 above any ratchet.
