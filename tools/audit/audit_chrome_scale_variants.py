"""audit_chrome_scale_variants.py — a chrome sheet must be exactly the scale it is declared as.

    python tools/audit/audit_chrome_scale_variants.py

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. Discord bug report, 2026-09: *"UI scaling above 150% messes up faction icons
and some UI in game"* — reproduced at 1080p and at 2800x1600, but NOT at 1440p.

The cause is not the scaling code. `chrome.yaml` declares each collection's regions ONCE, in 1x
coordinates, and `ChromeProvider` multiplies them by a HARDCODED density to index the variant
sheet. Read at the pinned engine (`mod.config` ENGINE_VERSION 462fc1fc4):

    if (dpiScale > 2 && Image3x != null) { image = Image3x; density = 3; }
    else if (dpiScale > 1 && Image2x != null) { image = Image2x; density = 2; }
    ...
    new Sprite(sheet, density * mi, TextureChannel.RGBA, 1f / density);

⛔ **MEASURE THE ARTWORK, NOT THE CANVAS. The first version of this audit compared canvas sizes
and was WRONG.** Upstream OpenRA pads 3x artwork into a power-of-two canvas -- 3 x 256 = 768 is
not a power of two, so `mods/ra/uibits/glyphs-3x.png` is a 1024x1024 file holding 768x768 of art.
By canvas size that looks like a 4x sheet; by artwork it is exactly 3x and entirely correct. Every
one of upstream's twelve variant declarations looks "4x" by canvas and is fine.

So the check is: the artwork's bounding box must equal the collection's 1x REGION EXTENT times the
density. Measured that way, exactly one sheet in this mod is wrong:

    ^Flags  region extent 384x512   3x wants 1152x1536   flags_3x.png has 1536x2048  <- 4x, WRONG
    ^Glyphs region extent 254x256   3x wants  762x768    glyphs_3x.png has  768x768  <- ok

⭐ AND THE MISREAD EXPLAINS THE SYMPTOM EXACTLY. With the engine reading at 3x from a 4x sheet, a
region at 1x (x, y) is read from (3x, 3y) while its art actually sits at (4x, 4y) — so the error
is PROPORTIONAL TO DISTANCE FROM THE TOP-LEFT CORNER:

    gdi      at 0,0     -> 100% of the correct pixels   (3*0 == 4*0, so the corner looks fine)
    nod      at 0,16    ->  67%
    XCOM     at 352,224 ->   0%   — completely different artwork
    Warcraft at 160,496 ->   0%

which is why it reads as "some UI" rather than "all UI", and why nobody spotted it from the first
few icons. Only the 3x path is affected, so whether a given player sees it depends on which DPI
bucket their resolution and UI scale land in — that is the whole "1440p is fine, 1080p is not".

WHAT IT CHECKS, for every collection in chrome.yaml that declares Regions:
  1. the ARTWORK bounding box of each declared variant equals the 1x region extent x its density
     (canvas size is ignored — padding to a power of two is the upstream convention);
  2. the canvas is at least big enough to hold that artwork;
  3. every region fits inside the 1x extent, since that is the coordinate space they are in.

⚠ Absence is fine and is the normal case — 71 collections here declare only `Image`. A missing
variant makes the engine fall back to a smaller sheet, which renders CORRECT pixels slightly
softer. A wrongly-LAID-OUT variant renders wrong pixels. Never "fix" a finding here by inventing a
file; re-lay the artwork at the right scale, or drop the declaration.

EXIT CODE: 1 on any wrongly-sized variant or out-of-bounds region.
