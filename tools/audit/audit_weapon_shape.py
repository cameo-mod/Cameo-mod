"""audit_weapon_shape.py ΓÇö THE ONE-WARHEAD / THREE-INHERIT LAW.

Γ¡É MAINTAINER RULING, 2026-09-06 (night). Binding, and it SUPERSEDES the
"intentional composite" exemption:

    "From now on we will no longer allow any more multi-warhead weapons. The only
     thing every weapon is allowed to have are exactly 3 inherits: warhead,
     projectile and effect. No more dual warheads, dual effects or dual projectiles
     or anything else. Also no more effects directly on the weapon itself ΓÇö it
     should all come from the inherited templates. The only thing allowed are
     special cases like those fire-shrapnel weapons or applying a condition."

So the target shape of EVERY concrete weapon is exactly:

    SomeWeapon:
        Inherits@wh:   ^Warhead_<Family>_<Level>
        Inherits@proj: ^Projectile_<Kind>_<Level>
        Inherits@fx:   ^Effect_<Kind>_<Level>
        <scalars only: Range, ReloadDelay, Report, Damage override, ...>

Γ¢ö WHAT THIS REPEALS. `tools/audit/intentional_composites.py` recorded 224 multi-main
weapons as REVIEWED AND DELIBERATELY KEPT. Under this ruling they are no longer
exempt ΓÇö they are the WORKLIST. The registry is still the right data (it says which
multi-main shapes were deliberate and what their mains are); only its MEANING flips,
from "leave alone" to "convert, and mind that someone chose these mains on purpose."

ΓÜá LEGITIMATE EXCEPTIONS, and they are narrow. A warhead is NOT a violation when it
delivers a MECHANIC rather than a second damage profile:
  * `FireShrapnel` / `FireFragment` / `FireCluster` ΓÇö spawn-another-weapon mechanics.
  * `GrantExternalCondition` ΓÇö applies a condition (shields, status meters).
  * `AreaDamagePercentage` / `*Percentage` twins ΓÇö the percentage half of one main.
  * `*FriendlyFire` / `*ExtraDamage` ΓÇö the baked halves of one main.
These are counted and shown, never failed on.

Buckets, each on its own LOWER-ONLY ratchet:

  W1  more than 3 inherits
  W2  two or more `^Warhead_*` inherits
  W3  two or more `^Projectile_*` inherits
  W4  two or more `^Effect_*` inherits
  W5  more than one resolved MAIN warhead   (the damage half of the law)
  W6  effect warheads declared LOCALLY on a concrete weapon
  I7  informational: weapons missing one of the three template inherits

ΓÜá I7 is INFORMATIONAL ON PURPOSE. A weapon with no `^Projectile_*` may legitimately
be an instant/utility weapon, so the number is a review queue, not a defect count.
Do not turn it into a ratchet without a per-weapon pass.
