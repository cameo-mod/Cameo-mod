"""audit_weapon_shape.py — THE ONE-WARHEAD / THREE-INHERIT LAW.

⭐ MAINTAINER RULING, 2026-09-06 (night). Binding, and it SUPERSEDES the
"intentional composite" exemption:

    "From now on we will no longer allow any more multi-warhead weapons. The only
     thing every weapon is allowed to have are exactly 3 inherits: warhead,
     projectile and effect. No more dual warheads, dual effects or dual projectiles
     or anything else. Also no more effects directly on the weapon itself — it
     should all come from the inherited templates. The only thing allowed are
     special cases like those fire-shrapnel weapons or applying a condition."

So the target shape of EVERY concrete weapon is exactly:

    SomeWeapon:
        Inherits@wh:   ^Warhead_<Family>_<Level>
        Inherits@proj: ^Projectile_<Kind>_<Level>
        Inherits@fx:   ^Effect_<Kind>_<Level>
        <scalars only: Range, ReloadDelay, Report, Damage override, ...>

⛔ WHAT THIS REPEALS. `tools/audit/intentional_composites.py` recorded 224 multi-main
weapons as REVIEWED AND DELIBERATELY KEPT. Under this ruling they are no longer
exempt — they are the WORKLIST. The registry is still the right data (it says which
multi-main shapes were deliberate and what their mains are); only its MEANING flips,
from "leave alone" to "convert, and mind that someone chose these mains on purpose."

⚠ LEGITIMATE EXCEPTIONS, and they are narrow. A warhead is NOT a violation when it
delivers a MECHANIC rather than a second damage profile:
  * `FireShrapnel` / `FireFragment` / `FireCluster` — spawn-another-weapon mechanics.
  * `GrantExternalCondition` — applies a condition (shields, status meters).
  * `AreaDamagePercentage` / `*Percentage` twins — the percentage half of one main.
  * `*FriendlyFire` / `*ExtraDamage` — the baked halves of one main.
These are counted and shown, never failed on.

Buckets, each on its own LOWER-ONLY ratchet:

  W1  more than 3 inherits
  W2  two or more `^Warhead_*` inherits
  W3  two or more `^Projectile_*` inherits
  W4  two or more `^Effect_*` inherits
  W5  more than one resolved MAIN warhead   (the damage half of the law)
  W6  effect warheads declared LOCALLY on a concrete weapon
  I7  informational: weapons missing one of the three template inherits

⚠ I7 is INFORMATIONAL ON PURPOSE. A weapon with no `^Projectile_*` may legitimately
be an instant/utility weapon, so the number is a review queue, not a defect count.
Do not turn it into a ratchet without a per-weapon pass.

# Ratchets established 2026-09-06 by THIS script's own first run. LOWER ONLY.
# (An earlier throwaway scan said 602/237/30/72; its regex was looser. Always set
#  a ratchet from the audit that enforces it, never from a scratch measurement.)
# W1 IS A RATE, NOT A COUNT (maintainer ruled 2026-09-12, after I explained the trade-off).
# Why: between ae02eedc0 and b235c698 the corpus grew 84 weapons (2061 -> 2145 concrete
# weapons with inherits). W1's absolute count rose 574 -> 585 and broke the ratchet, while its
# SHARE of the corpus FELL 27.85% -> 27.27%. The tree got proportionally cleaner and the gate
# went red anyway, purely because adding units adds violations at the prevailing rate. An
# absolute ratchet cannot tell "someone wrote a bad weapon" from "someone added a faction".
# W2 stays ABSOLUTE because its rate genuinely worsened (9.75% -> 10.54%) — that is a real
# regression and re-basing it would hide it.
#
# Stored in BASIS POINTS to keep the comparison integer-exact: fail iff
#   count * 10000 > W1_RATE_BP * corpus
# 585/2145 = 2727.3 bp, so 2728 is the current rate rounded up to the next basis point.
# LOWER ONLY — same rule as every count ratchet.
