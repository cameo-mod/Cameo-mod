"""Every source's group -> Cameo family review, loaded as one keyed store.

WHY A STORE AND NOT A FILE. The review began as a single hand-authored file because there was a
single reviewed source (Combined Arms). There are twenty sources, and the lane handoff had been
carrying an open question — *"a second source needs either a second file or a `source:` key per
block, decide that before starting, not halfway"* — since before the first one landed. This is
that decision, made the way the file itself already pointed: every assignment file ALREADY carries
a `source:` field, so the key exists and only the loader was missing.

Layout: `docs/reference/warhead_family_assignment*.yaml`, one file per source, keyed by the
`source:` inside it rather than by its filename. The filename is a convenience for humans; the
field is the identity, because a file can be renamed and a review cannot.

⚠ THE FILES STAY HAND-AUTHORED. R21 forbids rebuilding them from a name-matching pass, and R46
measured why: four independent matchers score ~20% against a 75% ceiling, and name evidence is
right 40% of the time on the 42% of weapons it can guess at all. This module LOADS reviews; it
must never generate one.

⚠ A PER-WEAPON OVERRIDE BEATS ITS GROUP. That is what makes a review survive re-clustering, and
`resolve()` is the one place that precedence is implemented — every consumer should call it rather
than reimplementing the `overrides` lookup, which is how `retau_assignment.py` came to manufacture
a straddle by letting an overridden weapon vote for its old group (R41).
