"""Score a family assignment against the one source where the answer is already known.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `propagate_families.py` carries the reviewed Combined Arms family assignments
onto the other sixteen sources by matching the measured DELIVERY x ELEMENT x BAND triple. That is a
proposal engine, and nothing measured whether its proposals were any good -- the plan was to put
1,059 of them in front of the maintainer.

But one source needs no propagation at all: Cameo. A Cameo weapon that inherits
`^Warhead_<Family>_<Level>` HAS a family, stated in the yaml, by construction (R37). 904 concrete
weapons carry such an inherit. That is a labelled test set, free, and it never needed a ruling.

So: compress Cameo's own weapons into groups exactly as every reference source is compressed, ask
the propagation what family each group should get, and compare against what Cameo actually says.
Any method that cannot recover Cameo's own assignments from Cameo's own weapons will not do better
on a mod nobody has reviewed.

WHAT THE FIRST RUN FOUND (2026-09-22, recorded as R39):

  propagation by triple   19% of groups get the right family   (top-4 candidates contain it: 38%)
  nearest profile shape   11%                                  (top-3 contain it: 19%)

  ...and the reason is not the method. It is the GROUPS. At the shipped `tau = 0.50` a single
  group holds a MEDIAN OF 3 distinct Cameo families (worst: 15), and only 11 of 53 groups are
  80% one family. No single-family label can be right about a group like that, so ~61% is the
  CEILING any method is playing against, not 100%.

  Tightening the clustering fixes the purity and costs group count:

      tau    groups   median purity   >=80% pure   usage-weighted purity
      0.50      162         61%          11/53             53%
      0.30      241         67%          18/61             67%
      0.20      302         75%          29/71             77%
      0.10      413         89%          47/71             84%

  All columns are over the SAME population -- groups with at least MIN_VOTERS labelled members.
  Usage weighting makes tau 0.50 WORSE (53% vs 61%), because the big groups are the mixed ones:
  `BulletHE_Veh` is 296 uses spanning CannonHE, Bullet, Demolition and more. Reviewing "just the
  important ones" therefore reviews precisely the groups a single label fits worst.

CEILING, NOT SCORE. A method scoring 60% here is not 40% wrong -- it may be at the ceiling the
group impurity allows. Always read `--purity` alongside the score.

    python tools/reference/validate_families.py              # score the current propagation
    python tools/reference/validate_families.py --purity     # the tau sweep above
    python tools/reference/validate_families.py --shape      # score nearest-profile instead
