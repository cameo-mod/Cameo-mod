"""W13 step 3 — a proposed Versus profile for every `^Warhead_<Family>_<Level>`.

This is where the three laws meet. For each Cameo family and level:

  1. **Platform** (DESIGN.md §12.0a) picks the reference rows — a family's LEVEL
     tracks the platform tier, so `_Light` learns from infantry and small turrets
     and `_Heavy` from heavy vehicles and big defences. Pooling all "lasers"
     together mixes a rifle with an Obelisk, which is the flattening W13 exists
     to undo.
  2. **The ordering law** (`gen_weapon_template.py`) places the values: macro
     priority x light/heavy direction. The corpus supplies magnitudes, never order.
  3. **The shape law** (DESIGN.md §12.0) finishes it: peak 100, no two values
     identical, uneven steps allowed, floor 10-25 (5 only for the deliberate
     extreme), then the derived armors.

    python tools/reference/propose_family_profiles.py
    python tools/reference/propose_family_profiles.py --family Laser
    python tools/reference/propose_family_profiles.py --write

⚠ **Families with no reference coverage are reported, not invented.** Melee,
Arrow, Magic, Sonic, Nuclear and the rest have no cross-mod equivalent to learn
from — they are Cameo's own inventions — so this prints "no source" for them
rather than borrowing a neighbouring family's numbers and calling it evidence.

⚠ **KNOWN LIMITATION — compressed blocks need a DESIGN decision, not more data.**
Where the corpus does not differentiate the rungs inside a macro block, the
no-ties rule can only separate them by its minimum step, and the output looks
like `Scout 96 · Light 97 · Medium 98 · Heavy 99 · Superheavy 100`. That is
honest — the canonical `AP` warhead really is ~100 against every armoured
target, because the source games never needed to tell a medium tank from a heavy
one — but it is not a usable Cameo ladder: five rungs spanning four points is
flat in everything but the letter of the law.

Read those blocks as *"the field says: all of these are top targets"* and let the
DESIGN spread them. The corpus cannot supply a distinction it never drew, and
padding one in here would disguise a design choice as a measurement.
