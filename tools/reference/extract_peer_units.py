"""Extract per-unit stats from a peer OpenRA mod's checkout, for the balance reference corpus.

PRIOR ART: `tools/reference/extract_versus.py` pulls WARHEAD/Versus profiles out of peer mods
(W13, feeding `versus_raw.json` and `aggregate_archetype.py`). This pulls UNIT stats — HP, Cost,
Speed — which that corpus deliberately does not carry. Different axis, no overlap.

    python tools/reference/extract_peer_units.py            # both mods, write the document
    python tools/reference/extract_peer_units.py --mod ca --dry-run

EXPLICIT EXPORT ROUTE (P4 provenance routing, OPENRA_WEAPON_EVIDENCE_PLAN_20260910):
    python tools/reference/extract_peer_units.py --root CA_CHECKOUT --mod ca \
        --json EXTERNAL_DIR/out.jsonl [--expect-commit 40HEXCOMMIT]

`--root` names ONE peer checkout explicitly (it must hold `mods/<mod_id>/mod.yaml`),
`--mod` must appear EXACTLY once, and `--json` writes a JSONL corpus OUTSIDE every git
repo and source checkout. The legacy CLI above is untouched and still writes Document 5;
explicit mode NEVER writes it. The JSONL's first line is a `meta` record carrying the
provenance contract: checkout HEAD + dirty state + engine pin, every ACTUALLY-read input
(mod.yaml, includes, rules/weapons/sequences, the fluent loader's .ftl reads, and
mod.config when present) hashed before AND after the extraction with `unchanged` flags,
all as checkout-relative names — never private absolute paths. Containment of every input
is checked on its RESOLVED target, so a junction/symlink that reaches outside the
checkout is refused. Runtime applicability of the source stays UNVERIFIED and neither
factory-ready nor maximum-upgrade states are certified. The local toolchain side of the
claim is bounded too: `LOCAL_DEPENDENCIES` (extractor, miniyaml, peer armor map) is
fingerprinted with per-file sha256, and the provenance carries that explicit scope. Git
failures are serialized as a bounded, path-free status (`git_unavailable`); raw git
stderr — which can quote private absolute paths — goes to console stderr only.
The checkout is only ever READ: git is called read-only (`rev-parse`, `status`) and no
source file or executable is ever run.

WHY IT EXISTS
-------------
`BALANCE_SYNTHESIS.md` §15 pools every reference source into a per-unit target, and
`ORIGINAL_UNIT_STATS.md` carries Combined Arms and Shattered Paradise as ROLE BANDS only —
"basic rifle 5000", "heavy trooper 7500-9000" — never as per-unit rows. So the two OpenRA peer
crossovers, the mods closest to Cameo in both engine and intent, could not vote on any named
unit. The single CA per-unit figure anywhere in the tree was the Apocalypse at 130,000 HP,
quoted as prose in §16. This closes that gap with real data.

⚠ THE RESOLVER IS NOT OPTIONAL. CLAUDE.md rule 8e forbids hand-parsing yaml, and an OpenRA actor
is a chain of `Inherits:` — `APOC` alone carries no HP; it comes from `^Tank` several levels up.
So this reads through `miniyaml.Ruleset`, which was parameterized by `mod_id` for exactly this
(it defaults to "cameo", so every existing caller is untouched). A regex over `vehicles.yaml`
would have returned nothing for most units and, worse, plausible numbers for a few.

⚠ EACH MOD SETS ITS OWN POWER LEVEL, so raw HP is meaningless across them. Every row is
normalized to that mod's own basic rifleman before it leaves here. Anchors are VERIFIED against
the checkout rather than trusted from a document — and one of them was wrong:
`ORIGINAL_UNIT_STATS.md` states "SP GDI rifle = 15000", but SP's `E1` (Light Infantry) resolves
to **12,500**. The artifact wins.

# Range, reload, burst, burst delays and raw damage need no armor taxonomy, so they are extracted
# now. Armor-aware effective DPS is deliberately NOT here: measured across the 13 peers there are
# 76 distinct Versus tags and only FIVE (None, Light, Heavy, Wood, Concrete) are shared by six or
# more mods. Generals Alpha declares 37, several of them per-unit
# (`vehicle.battle_bus.crate-1`); OpenRA Dune II declares none at all; Dune 2000 ships both
# `none` and `None`. A universal mapping is therefore not derivable from the data and must be
# hand-authored with per-source confidence — that is the next layer, and inventing it here would
# be fabricating a taxonomy.
#
# ⚠ `Versus` is a NODE WITH AN EMPTY VALUE whose CHILDREN are the armor rows. A probe using
# `node.get("Versus")` reads the empty value and concludes the mod has no Versus at all — which

# `weapon_stats` used to fold the FIRST `Armament`'s weapon and present it as
# the unit's damage summary; every further slot, its conditions and its ammo
# cadence were dropped in silence. The recorded casualty is CA `HMMV.TOW`,

#
#   * `nominal_direct` — the DECLARED contract that `w_dps` is the plain
#     direct Damage/ROF fold of ONE weapon. NEVER a complete unit DPS. It is
#     emitted only when the whole actor is provably simple: exactly ONE
#     resolved Armament slot, no PauseOnCondition / RequiresCondition /
#     UpgradeTypes on it, no AmmoPool (ammo is a cadence channel this fold
#     cannot read), no FirepowerMultiplier, a weapon that resolves through
#     the chain, every warhead a plain positive-Damage warhead seen through
#     fields we know, and a resolvable cadence — explicit BurstDelays
#     whenever Burst > 1 and an explicit ReloadDelay. The engine's
#     default-5 BurstDelays guess is NOT trusted here.
#   * `incomplete` (+ reason) — everything else: the raw first-weapon fold is
#     preserved on `w_dps_raw` (the old diagnostic; it votes nowhere),
#     `w_dps` is None, and EVERY resolved slot travels in `weapon_evidence`
#     with its raw warheads, conditions, targeting fields and ammo/rearm
#     bindings — for the future JSON export and for consumers to gate on.
#     Conditions are RETAINED, never assumed false or true: a gated slot is
#     recorded with its own weapon's numbers.

#     extra — a peer engine may give it semantics this fold cannot see.
