"""W13 step 2 — aggregate ONE weapon concept across every reference mod.

The maintainer's method (2026-08-15): *"research all the obelisk of light lasers
from all the mods and then see how that big laser versus values behaves against
all armor types … then try to extrapolate the values to all the cameo armor
types."* One concept at a time, two tables each:

  **Table A** — what each mod actually ships, in its OWN armor vocabulary.
  **Table B** — the same profiles mapped onto Cameo's 16 armor types.

    python tools/reference/aggregate_archetype.py obelisk
    python tools/reference/aggregate_archetype.py --list
    python tools/reference/aggregate_archetype.py --all --write

**How a warhead is identified matters more than the arithmetic.** For the INI
mods this TRACES the real chain — `[OBELISK] Primary=` -> `[weapon] Warhead=` ->
`[warhead] Verses=` — so what lands in the table is the weapon that building
actually fires, not a warhead whose name happened to contain "laser". A name
match would silently average an Obelisk with an infantry laser rifle, which is
precisely the flattening W13 exists to undo. OpenRA sources have no such flat
index here, so they use a curated warhead list, and every row says which method
produced it.

⚠ **Table B is EXTRAPOLATION, not measurement**, and it is labelled as such per
cell. Five of Cameo's 16 armors have no source equivalent — Heroic, Scout,
Superheavy and the four aircraft classes — because the Westwood engines carry
11 armors and share ONE of them between aircraft and ground vehicles.
Maintainer ruling 2026-08-15: *"some mods use light or heavy armor for aircraft
and you can translate that to our fighter, bomber, helicopter, spaceship"*, so
the air classes are read off the vehicle ladder by weight. The ladder ends
(Heroic / Scout / Superheavy) continue the ladder's own local slope.

    # Terror Drone, so mods routinely put a huge anti-drone bonus there: the Tesla
    # Coil's `Electric` warhead reads `drone 200` against ~100 for everything else.
    # Imported as Scout, that 200 is not a statement about scout vehicles at all,
    # and it does not even stay put: the ordering pass sorts the values and
    # reassigns them, so the 200 landed on **Superheavy** and produced a Tesla
    # ladder of `Scout 63 · Light 67 · Medium 71 · Heavy 75 · Superheavy 200`.

# ⚠ THE NORMALISATION LAW (maintainer, 2026-08-15):
#   *"everything needs to be normalized to 100% for the maximum versus value for
#    each game and each warhead from each game"*
#
# Every profile is rescaled so its OWN maximum is 100. This is per-WARHEAD, not
# per-source, and it is what makes cross-mod comparison mean anything:
#
#   * it removes engine scale differences outright — DTA runs on the Tiberian Sun
#     engine whose multipliers are x10 (measured median Versus 690 against 55-100
#     elsewhere), and a hand-maintained per-source divisor only ever fixed the
#     cases somebody had already noticed;
#   * it removes each mod's POWER LEVEL, which is not what we are borrowing. We
#     want the SHAPE — "twice as good against infantry as against tanks" — and a
#     mod that writes 200/100 and one that writes 100/50 are the same design;
#   * it makes the aggregate meaningful: averaging raw values weights whichever
#     mod happens to use the biggest numbers.
#
# What it deliberately discards is absolute lethality. That belongs to Damage and
# the level slope, not to the armor profile.
#
# ⚠ **REVISED 2026-08-15 — normalise to the MEDIAN, not the peak, and allow values
# above 100.** Anchoring on the peak looked safe and was not: RA2's Tesla warhead
# `Electric` reads `none 100 · plate 100 · medium 100 · heavy 100 · light 85 ·
# buildings 50 · DRONE 200`. The 200 is a niche anti-terror-drone bonus, but it is
# the row's maximum, so peak-normalisation halved every real armor and reported
# Tesla as 50-vs-infantry — a weapon famous for vaporising infantry. Mental Omega's
# `ElectricCoil` (drone 200 again) came out the same way, and the error survived
# into the family proposals as Tesla peaking on Superheavy with 30s everywhere else.
#
# One outlier must not be allowed to set the scale for fifteen other armors. The
# median is robust to exactly that: it says "100 is this weapon's TYPICAL
# effectiveness", and a genuine speciality is free to sit above it.
#
# Maintainer, 2026-08-15: *"should we be able to use maximum values above 100%? The
# old 100% upper limit was only because in the past we didn't have the versus values
# built into the weapon damage balance calculation, right?"* — exactly right. The K
# coefficient now measures the profile and prices it (W1), so a 200 is PAID FOR
# rather than free, and the cap was only ever protecting a formula that could not
# see it. The corpus itself runs to 320.

# THE VERSUS WINDOW (maintainer, 2026-08-15) — binding
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# *"the maximum versus value is 200 and the minimum versus value is 10 so the
#  normalized spread is 100-5 which is 20x"* — adopted.
#
# The ratio is the point, and it is unchanged: the old shape law's most extreme
# spread was peak 100 against floor 5, i.e. **20:1**, and `200 / 10` is the same
# 20:1 written on the median-100 scale that replaced the peak-100 one. So the
# window does not make weapons more specialised than the law already allowed; it
# fixes the SCALE the law is expressed on, which the move to median normalisation
# had left open-ended.
#
# ⚠ **20:1 is a legal maximum, never a target.** Measured across the corpus, the
# reference mods' own family profiles span only **1.3x to 7.2x** (`Laser/Heavy`
# 1.3, `MissileAP/Light` 7.2). Everything beyond that in a shipped profile comes
# from `shape_profile` stretching the measured shape onto the level's floor — a
# deliberate design step, not something the field said. Treating 20:1 as the goal
# would invent counter-play the reference does not support.

# which are products and so can land arbitrarily low on their own.
ABSOLUTE_FLOOR = 10.0

# Geometric mean cannot see a zero (any zero makes the whole product zero), and a
# hard 0 in a source means "immune". Clamping to 1 keeps the data point at
# "essentially immune" instead of deleting the row from the statistic.
GMEAN_FLOOR = 1.0

# Minimum separation between any two values in a profile. Maintainer, 2026-08-15:
# *"maybe make it steps of 2 instead of 1 for those? Minimum step of 2?"* — yes. A
# 1-point gap satisfies the no-ties rule on paper while being invisible in play;
# 2 is the smallest step a player could ever notice, so it is the smallest step
# worth spending a rung on.
MIN_GAP = 2.0

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# THE HEROIC RULE (maintainer, 2026-08-15)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# *"I was thinking of making Heroic an in-between of infantry Plate and vehicle
#  Scout … when the versus values were still multiplied, combining plate and
#  scout would be almost perfect, because it combines both infantry and vehicle
#  and at the same time light and heavy — so most weapons which are only good
#  against one of them would deal low damage to our heroes, and only those good
#  against BOTH are good against heroes as well."*
#
# That property comes from MULTIPLYING, and averaging destroys it:
#
#     anti-infantry weapon   Plate 100 · Scout 30  ->  avg 65   product 30
#     anti-vehicle weapon    Plate  20 · Scout 90  ->  avg 55   product 18
#     good against both      Plate  80 · Scout 80  ->  avg 80   product 64
#
# The average says the two specialists are nearly as good against a hero as the
# generalist. The product says exactly what the maintainer wants: specialists
# fall off a cliff, only the generalist stays high.
#
# So Heroic's VALUE is the product of the weapon's Plate and Scout values
# (as fractions, re-expressed as a percentage) — the old two-armor multiplication
# collapsed into one armor type.
#
# ⚠ **This does NOT reintroduce the W20 squaring bug.** W20 was two `Armor`
# TRAITS multiplying at runtime on one actor, which nobody designed. This is a
# single armor type whose numbers are computed once, at generation time, from a
# formula the designer chose. One armor trait is still enabled per hit.
#
# ⚠ **THE PATTERN GENERALISES, and it is the real fix for the dual-armor stacks.**
# `^FlyingInfantryTemplate` carries TWO `Armor` traits today — `Scout` and
# `Fighter` — for exactly the same reason Heroic wanted two: a jetpack trooper is
# both infantry and aircraft, and multiplying the two made only a weapon good at
# BOTH dangerous to it. Averaging (W20) silently removed that. A DERIVED armor
# type restores the behaviour with one trait, so W20's "two traits must never
# multiply" and this design stop being in conflict.
#
# Maintainer 2026-08-15: *"we need a new armor type for the flying infantry which
# is between helicopter and scout armor multiplied (same as heroic is plate x
# scout)"*. Name `Airborne` is provisional — maintainer to confirm.

# THE SPREAD RULE (maintainer, 2026-08-15)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# *"I still want a ladder (no two values should be identical) but it no longer
#  needs to be perfectly linear. And 100-5 should be the most hardcore spread
#  ever … 5% should be more like the exception than the rule. For less
#  specialized warheads you should be between 10 and 25 for the lowest value."*
#
#   * top of every profile is 100 (the normalisation law);
#   * NO TWO VALUES IDENTICAL anywhere in the profile — plateaus are what make a
#     weapon unreadable, and a tie is a wasted rung;
#   * steps need NOT be equal. Even ramps are exactly the "moderate middle" W13
#     exists to avoid; uneven steps are how a weapon says where it really bites;
#   * floor 10-25 for a normal weapon; **5 only for a deliberately hyper-
#     specialised one**, and it is meant to stay rare.
