"""THE C# CANNOT BE COMPILED HERE, SO THE STATE MACHINE IS PINNED IN PYTHON INSTEAD.

⛔ WHAT THIS FILE IS DEFENDING. `OpenRA.Mods.Cameo/Traits/DynamicBotInsurance.cs` replaces a
ten-rung yaml ladder with one trait holding a small state machine: a threshold that rises, freezes,
and re-arms, with a delay derived from a rolling average. A cloud container has no `engine/` and no
dotnet (CLAUDE.md rule 7), so that C# is unverified AS CODE until someone builds it. The state
machine, though, is exactly the part with non-obvious failure modes -- it can oscillate, stick at
zero, pay a rich player, or never fire at all -- and all of that IS verifiable here.

`tools/balance/bot_insurance_model.py` mirrors `Tick` line for line. These tests pin the behaviour
that mirror must have. ⚠ The two files must change together; `test_the_model_matches_the_csharp_defaults`
is the guard that notices when they do not, by parsing the field defaults straight out of the .cs.
