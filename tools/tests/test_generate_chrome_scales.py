"""THE SCALE GENERATOR MUST NEVER EAT THE ART MASTER.

⛔ TWO REAL HAZARDS, BOTH HIT WHILE BUILDING THE TOOL, BOTH NOW GUARDED.

1. **Self-overwrite.** Cameo's 4x master is *named* `flags_3x.png`. The first version of the tool
   happily ran `--emit 3` and replaced the highest-resolution source with its own downscale. The
   4x artwork would have been gone, silently, with a cheerful "wrote ..." line. It actually
   happened during testing and was only recoverable because of a manual backup.

2. **Padded masters.** Upstream OpenRA and Combined Arms pad 3x artwork into a power-of-two canvas
   (3 x 256 = 768 -> a 1024 file). Uniform-resizing such a master produces the right artwork ratio
   inside a nonsense canvas. Cameo's own `glyphs_3x.png` is exactly this shape, so the tool has to
   recognise and refuse it rather than "fix" a sheet that is already correct.

Both are the same underlying error — trusting the CANVAS or the FILENAME instead of measuring the
ARTWORK — which is the error that produced the original bug this whole thread is about.
