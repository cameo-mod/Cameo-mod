"""THE CONDITION EVALUATOR IS THE RISKY PART OF `audit_bot_insurance.py`.

⛔ THE ANTIPATTERN THIS FILE EXISTS TO PREVENT. CLAUDE.md rule 8e was paid for by a hand parser
that looked right and silently changed meaning. This audit has the same shape of risk in a smaller
place: it must turn an OpenRA condition expression into a boolean, and this mod is full of
NEAR-MISS identifiers — `mediumbot` is a substring of `mediumbotinsurance`, `easybot` of
`veryeasybot`. A `str.replace()` evaluator passes casual inspection and gets those wrong, which
would make the audit confidently report the wrong rung counts and "prove" the bug fixed when it is
not.

So these tests assert three things:

  1. the evaluator is TOKENISED — substrings of longer identifiers are never touched;
  2. operator precedence and parentheses behave (`!a && b || c` is not `!(a && b || c)`);
  3. **the audit's laws actually fire** on a ladder shaped like the real bug — a monotonicity dip
     and a zero-rung difficulty must both be caught.

Test 3 is the one that matters. Tests 1-2 alone would pass on an audit whose laws were never wired
to its exit code.
