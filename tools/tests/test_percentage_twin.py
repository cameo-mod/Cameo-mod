"""Unit tests for W15: percentage damage — the twin derivation and its reference HP.

Two maintainer rulings (2026-08-11) are pinned here:

1. The `*Percentage` twin must be CONTINUOUS in Damage. It used to be
   ``per // 2000``, so Damage 1999 produced a twin of 0 — not "a little damage"
   but hard immunity, arrived at purely by rounding. That is harmless only while
   every Damage value sits on the 2000 grid, which is exactly what W17 removes;
   hence this lands first.
2. `reference_hp` is a DESIGN constant of 200 000 — percentage damage is priced as
   if fired at an average baseline actor, not at the roster median (74 000, which
   infantry drag down). The measured figure stays reportable as a diagnostic.

The tests below deliberately assert BEHAVIOUR (monotonicity, no silent zero, the
constant's independence from the roster) rather than a table of magic numbers, so
they keep their meaning when the grid disappears.
