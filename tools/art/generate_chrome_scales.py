"""generate_chrome_scales.py — one master sheet in, every DPI variant out.

    python tools/art/generate_chrome_scales.py --list
    python tools/art/generate_chrome_scales.py flags --check
    python tools/art/generate_chrome_scales.py flags --write

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. `chrome.yaml` declares each collection's regions ONCE in 1x coordinates, and
`ChromeProvider` multiplies them by a density to index the variant sheet. Every variant therefore
has to be laid out at EXACTLY its density, and the only thing keeping four separate PNGs in that
relationship used to be somebody remembering. It was not remembered: `flags_3x.png` was authored at
4x, sat that way through a release, was fixed once in 2026-06 and reverted the same day. See
`docs/audit/CHROME_SCALE_BUG.md`.

⭐ THE FIX IS TO STOP MAINTAINING FOUR FILES. Edit the **highest-resolution master only**; this tool
derives the rest by uniform resize, which is correct BY CONSTRUCTION — a sheet's layout is
proportional, so scaling the whole canvas scales every icon's position and size together. There is
no offset to get wrong and no icon that can drift.

⚠ THE MASTER IS NOT A CHROME VARIANT. If the master is 4x, `--write` emits 1x/2x/3x from it. The
engine's ladder stops at 3x, so the generated 3x sheet is what ships; `flags_4x.png` is the editable
art source and is intentionally not declared in chrome.yaml.

⚠ RESAMPLING. Pillow (LANCZOS) is used when importable, otherwise a pure-Python area-average box
filter, and the tool PRINTS which. Both are correct; Pillow is sharper and much faster. 4x -> 2x and
4x -> 1x are exact integer ratios and effectively lossless; 4x -> 3x is a 0.75 resample, which is
why an artist may still prefer a native 3x export — `--check` will accept either.
