"""chrome_density_reach — which chrome sheet does a given display actually load?

⭐ WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A TABLE IN A DOC. The first hand-written version of this table got two of
its five rows wrong — 1920x1080 was quoted as 1.87 (that is the WIDTH term; the height term binds
at 1.50) and a 3456x2234 Retina panel was quoted as 3.00 when it actually reaches 3.06 and would
therefore USE a 4x sheet. Two ceilings multiply and a min() picks between four terms; that is one
step past what is safe to do in your head, so it is code.

⛔ EVERY CONSTANT HERE IS COPIED FROM ENGINE SOURCE, and each is cited. Re-derive them against
`cameo-mod/OpenRA` if the engine is bumped — this file is a MODEL of the engine, not the engine.

    ChromeProvider.cs:117           if (dpiScale > 2 && Image3x) density = 3;
                                    else if (dpiScale > 1 && Image2x) density = 2;
    Renderer.cs:386                 WindowScale => Window.EffectiveWindowScale
    Sdl2PlatformWindow.cs:77-82     EffectiveWindowScale = windowScale * scaleModifier
                                      windowScale  = OS display scale (SDL_GetDisplayDPI/96,
                                                     Xft.dpi/96, GDK_SCALE, or the GL points ratio
                                                     on macOS) -- forceable via OPENRA_DISPLAY_SCALE
                                      scaleModifier = the game's Graphics.UIScale setting
    Sdl2PlatformWindow.cs:280       windowSize = surfaceSize / windowScale   <-- LOGICAL, not pixels
    DisplaySettingsLogic.cs:628     validScales = {1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2} filtered by
                                    maxScale = NativeResolution / MinEffectiveResolution
    WorldViewportSizes.cs:27        MinEffectiveResolution = 1024x720 (Cameo does not override it;
                                    mod.yaml:523 sets only DefaultScale/MaxZoom*)

⚠ BECAUSE `NativeWindowSize` IS LOGICAL, THE OS SCALE CANCELS in the dropdown's own limit — so the
reachable dpiScale is bounded by the PHYSICAL panel alone, and separately by 2 x the OS scale.
Both bounds bind in practice, which is why 4K stops at exactly 3.00 and a 4x rung would be dead
there while a smaller-but-denser Retina panel reaches it.

⚠ The UI Scale DROPDOWN caps at 2.0; the SETTING does not. `Graphics.UIScale` written straight
into settings.yaml is clamped only by BlankLoadScreen.cs:117, and only to reset to 1.0 below the
minimum resolution. That plus OPENRA_DISPLAY_SCALE is how to exercise a 4x path without owning a
5K display.
