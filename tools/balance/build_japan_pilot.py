"""Bounded DIAGNOSTIC Japan reference pilot — first testable pilot evidence, NOT a live rebalance.

For every Japan actor present in `reference_distribution.cameo_rows()` this shows the current
HP/speed/range/cost next to the R4 reference target, and derives an UNAPPROVED per-class
sensitivity from the classic originals (TD GDI/Nod, RA1 Allies/Soviets) only:

  * Donors are ORIGINAL actors (`build_reference_report.is_original`) of the four classic
    factions, strictly joined by source+ID through `faction_extrapolate.paired_rows` — the
    name fallback inside `reference_targets.attach` is deliberately NOT used.
  * The R4 target per axis is `reference_targets.target_for` over the strict rows and their
    `reference_targets.expand_families` families, against the `reference_distribution`
    aggregates (plus the cost distribution via `reference_targets.add_cost_distribution`).
  * Per current combat class (`class_membership.classify`) and axis, the exploratory ratio is
    the geometric mean over eligible donors of (R4 target / current). A pool needs
    >= 3 distinct donor originals from >= 2 classic factions, each donor axis value backed by
    >= 2 reference sources. No-class, support, pending-reclass and Japan donors are excluded;
    invalid/missing numbers are excluded per axis. Pools are built only for classes that
    actually occur among the Japan rows — deliberately bounded, no all-class sweep.
  * The ratio is applied ONLY to Japan's current HP/speed/range as UNAPPROVED sensitivity.
    One class ratio applied to every member preserves the existing relative positions inside
    the class; it does not invent an identity for Japan.

⛔ WHAT THIS IS NOT. Sensitivity only: this artifact proposes no price and changes no price —
the broader pipeline stays free to propose reference prices through its own authorized stages
(initial reference price placement, then joint stats-and-price grid fitting). None of that
happens here: no DPS target, no new-price target, no anchor fitted or signed, no apply
interface. The method preserves existing imbalances and is not proof against the reference.
Class tier, weapon structure and sign-off block application.

Output goes ONLY to an external directory through `diagnostic_output.write_outputs`,
deterministically (no timestamps, no fallbacks). Input provenance is fingerprinted
repo-relative for every file actually consumed — including the peer corpus, the Document-1
table, the extracted INI corpus, the ledger population and the code of the import closure —
and no lineage beyond that list is claimed. The pending-classes overlay is READ-ONLY input
(this tool never imports `pending_classes.py`, which writes files); an absent overlay is
reported as `NOT_CHECKED`, never as "no pending actors".
