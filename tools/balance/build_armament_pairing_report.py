WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. It reads the EXISTING actor-to-actor assignment
(`reference_assignment.json`) and, inside each already-decided pair, matches the two units'
armaments by targeting role. It re-scores nothing, re-assigns nothing and writes no balance
number — clause 2 of the matching law ("at most ONE reference unit per source") is untouched,
because this splits what the pair MEANS, not which pair it is.

⛔ THE DEFECT IT MEASURES. `armament_profile` folds an actor's baseline armaments into one
`w_range` / `w_damage` / `w_dps`, taking `max(ranges)` for the range. On a single-weapon unit that
is exactly right. On `td_gdi_firehawk` it reports the Sidewinders' 12,500 for a bomb that reaches
1,250 — a TEN-FOLD error inside one row, and the maintainer named it before the tooling found it:

    "those fire bombs and the sidewinder anti air missiles have separate ranges ...
     Those two weapons are so different they should not be mixed."

⭐ THE PAIRING KEY IS THE TARGETING ENVELOPE, not the weapon's name — see `armament_roles`, which
carries the reasoning, the measured token vocabularies and the reason a name test cannot work.
