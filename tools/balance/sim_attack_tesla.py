"""sim_attack_tesla.py — a source-derived `AttackTesla` timing model.

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. Four numbers have been published for one building's attack period
(`asianalliance_railtower`): 160, 172, 180 and 220. Three are wrong, and two of the wrong
ones were mine — both produced by reading the trait and reasoning about what it "should"
do. So this file does not reason. It transcribes the engine's state machine and runs it.

THE MODEL, file by file:

  AttackTesla.cs      `ChargeAttack` queues `Wait(InitialChargeDelay)` then `ChargeFire`.
                      `ITick` refills `charges` when `timeToRecharge` expires, and
                      `INotifyAttack.Attacking` resets that to the trait's `ReloadDelay` on
                      every real shot — so the trait reload runs from the LAST shot.
  AttackBase.cs       `CanAttack` calls `HasAnyValidWeapons(target, reloadingIsInvalid: true)`,
                      whose loop sets `reloadingStateIsValid = !reloadingIsInvalid ||
                      !armament.IsReloading`. **A reloading armament therefore makes
                      `CanAttack` FALSE.**
  Armament.cs         `IsReloading` is `FireDelay > 0`; `Tick` decrements `FireDelay`.
  Activity.cs:126-133 "avoid a single tick delay if the childactivity was just queued" — a
                      freshly queued child ticks in the same tick, which is what makes
                      `Wait(N)` block its parent for exactly N ticks rather than N+1.

⭐ THE LOAD-BEARING LINE, and the one I got wrong twice:

    ChargeFire.Tick:  if (IsCanceling || !attack.CanAttack(self, target)) return true;

`ChargeFire` does **not** spin while the weapon reloads — it EXITS. `ChargeAttack` carries
the identical guard, so it exits too and the whole attack activity ends. The actor then
reacquires and comes back in through `ChargeAttack`, which pays `InitialChargeDelay` AGAIN.

That gives the mode detection the maintainer asked for, with no per-actor knowledge and no
trait-name special case — just `ChargeDelay` against the weapon's reload:

    weapon reload <= ChargeDelay   the volley is never interrupted.  CHARGE-ONCE:
                                   gap = ChargeDelay
    weapon reload >  ChargeDelay   ChargeFire exits after every shot. CHARGE-PER-SHOT:
                                   gap = weapon reload + InitialChargeDelay

    cycle = (MaxCharges - 1) * gap + trait ReloadDelay + InitialChargeDelay

With immediate reacquisition this reproduces all three maintainer rulings — 131, 95 and **220** — including
*"for the asian alliance railgun tower it needs to charge for every shot unlike the tesla
coil! So at 5 shots the initial charge delay is used 5 times!"*, which is precisely what
the guard produces.

⭐⭐ THE REACQUISITION INPUT IS NO LONGER UNRESOLVED — IT IS MEASURED, AND IT IS A RANGE.
`AutoTarget` is what restarts a charged actor whose activity ended, and its schedule is not
a mystery: `INotifyIdle.TickIdle` -> `ScanAndAttack` -> `ScanForTarget`, which does nothing
unless `nextScanTime <= 0` and then re-arms it with

    nextScanTime = self.World.SharedRandom.Next(MinimumScanTimeInterval, MaximumScanTimeInterval)

`AutoTargetInfo` declares 3 and 8, no Cameo yaml overrides either, and .NET's
`Random.Next(min, max)` excludes its upper bound — so the scan interval is uniform over
{3, 4, 5, 6, 7}: mean 5, never 8. Note the re-arm happens BEFORE `ChooseTarget`, so a scan
costs its interval whether or not it leads to a shot, and `ChooseTarget` does not care that
the weapon is reloading — it returns the target, `ChargeAttack` is queued, and `CanAttack`
kills it again. The actor therefore polls its own reload on a 3-7 tick lattice.

⭐ WHICH IS WHY THIS AFFECTS THE RAIL TOWER AND ONLY THE RAIL TOWER. A charge-once actor
never goes idle: after its last zap `ChargeFire` returns true, and `ChargeAttack` — reached
in the same tick — finds `charges == 0` with the weapon ready and returns FALSE, holding the
activity open through the whole trait reload. No idle tick, no scan, no latency. Only the
charge-per-shot mode ends its activity mid-volley, and only it pays.

So the Rail Tower has no single period. `--autotarget` measures the distribution:

    220   floor    every reacquisition lands the instant the weapon is ready
    ~231  typical  the expected forward recurrence into a U{3..7} lattice is 2.7 ticks
    248   ceiling  every reacquisition misses by the full interval

⛔ 220 IS THE FLOOR, NOT THE ANSWER. The maintainer's ruling and the immediate model agree
on it exactly, and that agreement is real evidence about the MECHANISM — charge-per-shot —
but the runtime cadence is a distribution and pricing it needs a decision about which
statistic to use. That decision has not been made, so nothing here is applied.

⚠ A SECOND-ORDER EFFECT THIS MODEL DOES INCLUDE: `timeToRecharge` is reset by every shot,
so scan latency inside a volley pushes the last shot later and delays the refill with it.
The volley period therefore grows by the accumulated latency, not by a single interval.

⚠ A SECOND CAVEAT THE TRACE DOES NOT SETTLE: `DoAttack` calls `CheckFire` on EVERY armament
and `Attacking` decrements `charges` once per firing armament. The RA1 coil declares 3
armaments and the RA2 coil 6, all condition-gated. This assumes exactly one is enabled —
which is what reproduces 131 and 95.

⛔ NOTHING HERE IS APPLIED. `armament_roles` still withholds the charge term; the
implemented Tesla Coil period is still 106. This is evidence for a decision, not a change.
