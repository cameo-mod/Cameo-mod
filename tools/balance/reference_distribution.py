"""Distribution-relative reference synthesis — the CHASSIS layer (HP, speed, turn rate).

PRIOR ART: `synthesize_reference.py` pools reference units as a ratio to each source's basic
RIFLEMAN. This replaces that transfer key rather than duplicating it — it imports that module's
document parsers and roster loader, and adds the distribution machinery the rifle method cannot
express. Weapons (damage, range, burst, reload, effective DPS) are a later layer, by maintainer
scoping; nothing here reads a weapon.

    python tools/balance/reference_distribution.py
    python tools/balance/reference_distribution.py --stat hp --type vehicle --limit 30

WHY THE RIFLE HAD TO GO (maintainer, 2026-08-30)
------------------------------------------------
*"What if that game doesn't have any infantry and only uses vehicles?"* — exactly. Anchoring every
comparison on one nominated actor has four failure modes, and this corpus hits all four:

  * a source with no infantry has no anchor at all;
  * "basic rifleman" is a different design object in each game — a 40 HP Marine, a 12,500 HP Light
    Infantry, a 125 HP Conscript — so the same ratio means different things;
  * one odd anchor silently rescales every unit measured against it;
  * it answers "how many riflemen is this worth", which is not a question anyone balances by.

The replacement is POSITION IN DISTRIBUTION. A unit is described by where it sits inside its
source's own spread, and that description is dimensionless, so it transfers to Cameo without ever
needing the two games to share a scale.

THE COORDINATE SYSTEM
---------------------
For each source S, each stat X, and each population P (the unit's TYPE, and the OVERALL combat
roster), compute five aggregates — min, max, median, arithmetic mean, geometric mean — and place
the unit against them:

    r_min = X/min · r_max = X/max · r_med = X/median · r_am = X/mean · r_gm = X/geomean
    p_rng = (X - min) / (max - min)                      # 0.0 at the floor, 1.0 at the ceiling

`p_rng` exists because ratios to MIN and MAX are not commensurate with the middle three: a source
whose floor is a 1 HP joke actor makes r_min read 35,000 while r_max reads 0.9. Keeping both means
the well-behaved coordinate is available when the ratio misbehaves, and the disagreement between
them is itself a signal that the source's floor or ceiling is junk.

SYNTHESIS
---------
Every coordinate is pooled across sources with the GEOMETRIC mean — these are ratios, and in ratio
space a source 2x high and one 2x low must cancel to 1.0, which only the geometric mean does.
`p_rng` is already bounded [0,1] and is pooled arithmetically; a geometric mean of a coordinate
that can legitimately be 0 is undefined.

⚠ NEVER GEOMETRIC-AVERAGE RAW STATS ACROSS SOURCES. 125 HP and 12,500 HP are the same design
intent at different scales; averaging them produces a number belonging to no game. Only the
dimensionless coordinates are pooled. This module never mixes raw values from two sources.

PROJECTION BACK
---------------
Each synthesized coordinate is multiplied by CAMEO's own matching aggregate, giving one candidate
absolute per coordinate; the final target is the geometric mean of those candidates. So a unit
that sits at 2.2x its source's vehicle median lands at 2.2x CAMEO's vehicle median.

⚠ THIS WRITES NO LEDGER, NO YAML AND NO ANCHOR. It is a measurement. The reference says what SHAPE
a unit has across the genre; `class_anchors` and Formula V2 still decide what Cameo ships, and
`docs/design/ORIGINAL_UNIT_STATS.md` is explicit that source games are an identity lookup, not a
prescription.

# ── Lineage de-duplication (maintainer ruling, 2026-08-30) ────────────────────────────────────
# "RV is the OpenRA implementation of RA2 and YR so it already covers everything from the original
# RA2 and YR games ... there is no benefit in duplicating it."
#
# One vote per BALANCE LINEAGE, not per file. Measured before applying: the five vanilla copies
# agree with each other on 96% of shared units (118/123), which is what makes them one lineage.
# ⚠ Recorded caveat, because it is the maintainer's call and not the data's: RV is NOT a faithful
# copy. On the 86 units where the other copies agree and RV is present, RV is the SOLE dissenter
# on 39 of them (45%) — Kirov 32x vs 16x, Aegis Cruiser 3.2x vs 6.4x, Flak Track 2.4x vs 1.4x. So
# electing RV as the lineage's voice adopts RV's rebalance for those units rather than vanilla's
# consensus. That is a defensible choice (RV is the live, resolvable OpenRA codebase); it is just
# not a no-op, and this note exists so nobody later reads it as one.
# ⛔ A LINEAGE COLLAPSE **SELECTS** A REPRESENTATIVE. IT DOES NOT RELABEL AND MERGE.
# The first implementation renamed every RA2-family row to "Romanov's Vengeance", which quietly
# poured three rosters at INCOMPATIBLE SCALES into one distribution: RV runs 100..400,000 HP while
# OpenRA RA2 and YR-on-OpenRA run 25..2,000. The merged population's median/min came out at 100 —
# not because RV has a 100 HP prop (it has a Terror Drone, a perfectly legitimate unit) but
# because the low tail was full of Westwood-scale rows sitting under an OpenRA-scale ceiling.
# That is the exact failure this module's own header forbids: raw values from two sources must
# never share a statistic. Members are now DROPPED; only the representative's roster survives.
# ⛔ THIS LIST USED TO LIVE HERE, AND IT CARRIED A MEMBER THAT NEVER MATCHED: `"RA2/YR"`, while
# the parser labels that source `"RA2/YR (raw INI)"`. Three copies of the rulings existed and had
# drifted apart; they are now one, in `reference_lineages.py`, and `lineage_dedup.py` fails when a
# label there is absent from the corpus so the same typo cannot recur silently.

# ── THE POPULATION RULE (maintainer, 2026-08-30) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# "Only use buildable units and no epic units with build limits! Only unlimited units / defenses
#  that can be built should be considered. Also Cameo's heroes and epic units must be excluded
#  since they will be balanced separately."
#
# So a row enters a distribution only if it is BUILDABLE and UNLIMITED. Three exclusions, and each
# has a distinct reason:
#
#   not buildable      — it never reaches a player's hands, so it is not part of the balance the
#                        roster expresses (husks, map props, campaign-only actors).
#   BuildLimit present — a one-off. `check_band.py:142` already defines Cameo's epic/hero
#                        predicate as exactly `bool(u.get("build_limit"))`, and that predicate is
#                        reused verbatim rather than restated.
#   epic_vehicle class — belt and braces on the Cameo side: an epic that somehow carries no
#                        build_limit is still an epic, and epics are balanced separately.
#
# ⚠ This is not merely a filter, it is a CORRECTION. Cameo's vehicle ceiling was a 3,000,000 HP
# epic, which made its max/median 35x against peers' 2.8-16x and inflated every projection through
# the max coordinate. Removing one-offs removes that distortion at the source rather than damping
# it downstream — which is why the percentile guard below is now a safety net rather than a crutch.

# the ten relative values needs a population per type, and DOC4's tables have no type column at all.
#
# ⭐ THE UNITS DO NOT NEED CONVERTING. Every coordinate is dimensionless and every distribution is
# built from ONE source's own values, so MO's damage in Westwood points and Combined Arms' in
# OpenRA points never meet. DOC1 measures range in CELLS and reload in FRAMES where DOC5 uses world
# distance and ticks; the ratios are identical either way.
#
# ⚠ THREE HONEST LIMITS, none of them silent:
#   * no `Turret`, `Burst` or armour columns -> these sources abstain on turn_ratio, w_burst and
#     every `dps_vs_*` coordinate rather than contributing a guess;
#   * `w_dps` is derived as Damage/Reload, which is proportional to real DPS within a source and
#     therefore fine for a ratio, but is NOT comparable to DOC5's measured DPS as a raw number;
#   * ⛔ NO BUILD-LIMIT COLUMN, so THE POPULATION RULE CANNOT BE FULLY APPLIED. DOC5 rows drop
#     one-off epics and heroes via `Limit`; these cannot, so a hero may sit inside MO's or CnCR's
#     distribution and stretch its tail. `cost > 0` removes the decoys and campaign props (MO lists

# and the slot-prefixed twins (`w2_*` = secondary, `wdummy_*` = demoted primary) carry the same
# identity/status pair for the row's OTHER weapon identities. Labels assert WHAT WAS ASSESSED,
# never completeness:
#
# ⛔ THE CONSUMER BUG THIS POLICY FIXES: `ini_rows` and `peer_hero_rows` copied `w_dps` and the
# armor-adjusted `dps_vs_*` while dropping `w_evidence` — so a weapon the extractor itself
# declined to certify arrived downstream as an authoritative DPS target with the caveat
# deleted. A ratio built from damage the direct-channel fold cannot read is exactly the class
# of number this file's own header forbids.
#
# What each state does to the CONSUMER values (`w_dps`, `dps_vs_*`). It touches NOTHING else —
# hp, speed, cost survive verbatim, the other weapon fields (`w_range`/`w_damage`/`w_burst`/
# `w_reload`, which matching clause 5 uses to tell "armed" from "unarmed") survive too, and
# ELIGIBILITY's `requires: w_dps` then naturally abstains the row from every weapon-layer
# distribution while it keeps voting on the chassis:
#   * MISSING/absent on a legacy row -> "legacy-unassessed": ABSENT STATUS IS LEGACY —
#     the boolean behaviour of the committed corpus is retained verbatim (compatibility)
#     and the label asserts nothing; it is NEVER certified complete;
#   * the extractor's own verdicts, matched EXACTLY: `nominal_direct` (underscore — its
#     declared contract: w_dps is the plain direct Damage/ROF estimate, never a proven
#     total) and `supported`/`conventional` -> unchanged numeric behaviour, labelled with
#     the verdict itself;
#   * "incomplete"/"unverified" -> WITHHELD: the raw direct estimate moves to `w_dps_raw`
#     (kept separately for inspection, voting nowhere) and `w_dps` plus every `dps_vs_*` is
#     withheld;
#   * an EXPLICIT `w_dps_usable: False` -> withheld as well, whatever the label says;
#   * any OTHER explicit status -> withheld too, labelled AS ITSELF, UNNORMALIZED. The
#     contract is exact-string: an arbitrary unknown status is never harmlessly normalised
#     into a trusted one nor folded into another verdict — coordination is conservative in
#     the direction of trust: an explicit verdict the consumer does not know
#     is not proven evidence. `evidence_counts` reports the mix so a rename upstream cannot
#     hide here silently.
#
# ⛔ THE SLOT PREFIX NEVER GATES THE PRIMARY. A `wdummy_evidence: incomplete` describes the
# DEMOTED weapon, not the one voted on here — DTA's X-O Power Suit: the promoted machine gun
# keeps its own evidence verdict, and no comment here calls the promoted result a complete
# UNIT measurement, because Westwood Primary/Secondary is TARGET-SELECTED and the tie the

# The Doc 5 emitter (`extract_peer_units.py`) appends `Evidence | Reason` to every table so the
# OpenRA peers can carry the SAME verdict vocabulary the INI corpus does (`nominal_direct` /
# `incomplete` + reason). The table parser lowercases header cells and strips backticks, so the
# parsed row dict `d` keys are `evidence` / `reason` / `usable`; this mapper turns one row into
# the canonical rec shape `apply_weapon_evidence` consumes. The policy, its exact-string
# vocabulary and its fail-closed direction are defined THERE — no second copy lives here.
#
# The `—` cell is the emitter's empty convention (`str(value or "—")`), NOT a status: a
# placeholder or blank cell maps to ABSENT, and absent is legacy-unassessed. A legacy table
# predating the columns has no `evidence` key at all — same destination — so the committed
# corpus keeps its numeric behaviour verbatim until it is regenerated.
#
# ⛔ `usable`, WHEN the column exists, is parsed STRICTLY: exactly `True`/`true` or
# `False`/`false`. A string "False" is a FALSE, never a truthy string, and any other non-empty
# token (`yes`, `1`, a typo) FAILS CLOSED: the fold is withheld (`w_dps_usable: False`) with a
# diagnostic reason, because a boolean the consumer cannot parse is not evidence the fold may
# be consumed. An absent column, `—` cell or blank cell carries no usable verdict at all and
# leaves the evidence label alone in charge. (An emitter that adds this column must write the
# token `False` explicitly — the `or "—"` placeholder pattern would swallow a Python False.)
