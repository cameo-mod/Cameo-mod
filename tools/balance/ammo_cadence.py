"""The FOUR cadence regimes. An ammo pool makes `ReloadDelay` the wrong clock.

    MAINTAINER, 2026-09-12, three rulings in one session:
      "there are units that work with an ammo pool. For example the SSM launcher reload delay
       in cameo doesn't matter since it requires ammo to shoot which regenerates on the actor
       itself! Also our helicopters have a reloading ammo pool and combined with their ammo
       pool and ammo consumption per shot it means they are designed to shoot for 5 seconds at
       full speed and then after that at half speed"
      "For helicopters what we compare is only that time they shoot at full speed ... we take
       into account how much damage they can deal from full to empty ammo pool and in what time
       and calculate that as the DPS."
      "For planes that need to reload on the airfield we also compare the maximum damage they
       can deal from their ammo pool before it's empty but reload delay means nothing there so
       we only compare the maximum damage per sortie."

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. The ledger computes one number for every armed actor —
`damage x burst / (reload + burst delays)` — and NOTHING in `extract_stats`,
`reference_distribution` or `formula` mentions `AmmoPool`. Measured: **145 Cameo actors have
one**. For all 145 the weapon's `ReloadDelay` is
not the clock, so the ledger's DPS is measuring something the unit cannot sustain — and a
pipeline-written reload change would move the ledger's number while changing nothing in game.

`td_nod_ssmlauncher` is the proof, and it is exact:

    weapon honestjohn   ReloadDelay 225 + BurstDelays 25   -> cycle 250 ticks, burst 2
    AmmoPool            Ammo 2
    ReloadAmmoPool      Delay 125, Count 1                 -> 2 rounds per 250 ticks

Weapon rate and ammo rate are IDENTICAL (2 shots / 250 ticks). The reload is decorative: ammo
gates the launcher either way, which is exactly what the maintainer said.

THE FOUR REGIMES:

  1. NO POOL          dps = damage x burst / cycle              (today's formula, correct)
  2. SELF-RELOADING   dps = pool damage / time to empty
     (`ReloadAmmoPool`)  a RATE. The pool bounds the DURATION of full-rate fire, not the rate
                         within it, so the trailing reload never happens and is excluded.
  3. AIRFIELD REARM   sortie_damage = pool damage, and NO dps at all
     (`Rearmable`)       a TOTAL. Comparing a rate would be a category error: the plane empties
                         its pool, flies home and is out of the fight. Ruled explicitly.
  4. FINITE, UNCLASSIFIED   a pool with neither self-reload nor `Rearmable` -- no replenishment
     (neither trait)    mechanism this module knows. Reported, never scored. It is where the
                        spell-charge pools land (`wc2_humans_mage`, `Ammo: 255`).
  ⚠ SINGLE-SHOT POOLS, orthogonal to the four: a pool affording ONE shot delivers its damage
    instantly, so no elapsed time exists to divide by and no rate does either. Flagged
    `single_shot` with `dps: None`; the regime label is KEPT, because an airfield plane carrying
    one bomb is still an airfield plane.

ENGINE FACTS, read from source rather than assumed (OpenRA checkout, not guessed):
  * `AmmoPoolInfo.Ammo` (default 1) is the magazine; `ReloadCount` 1 and `ReloadDelay` 50 are
    the AIRFIELD rearm, NOT self-reload -- `AmmoPool.cs` sets `RemainingTicks` from it only in
    the rearm path.
  * Self-reload is a SEPARATE trait, `ReloadAmmoPool` -- `Delay` (default 50) and `Count`
    (default 1). Its ABSENCE does not imply an airfield plane -- see the gate note below.
  * `Armament.AmmoUsage` (default 1) is consumed per `Attacking` notification, i.e. per SHOT,
    not per burst (`AmmoPool.cs` `INotifyAttack.Attacking` -> `TakeAmmo(self, a.Info.AmmoUsage)`).
  * `WeaponInfo.BurstDelays` defaults to `[5]`, NOT 0 -- so an undeclared burst delay still
    lengthens the cycle. A single entry applies between every pair of shots; otherwise the list
    must be `Burst - 1` long (`Armament.cs` throws otherwise).

⚠ `time_to_empty` DROPS THE TRAILING RELOAD, and includes any reload ticks that occur before
the magazine empties. A pool holding exactly one burst never waits at all: the SSM launcher
fires 2 rounds 25 ticks apart and is empty, so its per-sortie rate is `2 x damage / 25`, not
`2 x damage / 250` -- a 10x difference on one unit. Including the trailing reload would measure
a cycle the unit never completes.

# ⛔ REGIME 3 IS GATED ON `Rearmable`, NOT ON THE ABSENCE OF SELF-RELOAD. The first cut used
# "has AmmoPool, has no ReloadAmmoPool" and that misclassified 44 actors, most of them not
# aircraft at all:
#   * `wc2_humans_mage`  Mobile, seven Armaments, `AmmoPool Ammo: 255` -> a SPELL CHARGE pool
#     with a sentinel size. Reporting 4,590,000 "sortie damage" for a mage is nonsense.
#   * `A10Carrier`       Aircraft + AttackAircraft + `Ammo: 16` but NO `Rearmable` -> a
#     one-pass strike craft that never returns to rearm.
#   * `atreides_ornithopter`  Aircraft + AttackAircraft + `Rearmable` (19 RearmActors) +
#     `AmmoPool@PRIMARY Ammo: 5` -> THIS is the plane the ruling is about.

# pool with neither self-reload nor `Rearmable` replenishes by NO mechanism this module knows,
