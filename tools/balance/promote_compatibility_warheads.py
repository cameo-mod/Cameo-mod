"""Promote every ^Compatibility_* shim into a REAL ^Warhead_* template that INHERITS its twin.

    MAINTAINER, 2026-09-12:
      "Any of those silly compatibility warheads must be resolved and replaced by an
       actual new warhead"

WHY THIS IS A RENAME AND NOT ARITHMETIC. `DESIGN.md` recorded this slice as "damage-preserving
arithmetic per weapon, needs warhead permission", because the shim ships `Damage: 0` and yet 365
of its 416 users resolve a nonzero damage on that node. Half right: the shim IS the damage
carrier, so its inherit cannot simply be dropped. But it never followed that the damage has to
MOVE. `^Compatibility_<X>Flat` is the landing zone of an EARLIER W24 pass -- `YamatoCannon`:

    Warhead@Demolition_Heavy:  Damage: 20000
    Warhead@CannonHE_Heavy:    Damage: 20000
    -Warhead@CannonHE_Heavy:
    -Warhead@Demolition_Heavy:
    Warhead@CannonHE_HeavyFlatCompatibility:
        Damage: 40000              <- two mains, already folded into one, parked on the shim

The weapon is already single-main and already correct. Its only defect is that the template it
inherits is not spelled `^Warhead_`. So spell it `^Warhead_`: no damage moves, no Versus row
changes, and no warhead permission is needed because no warhead changes.

⛔ THE TRAP THAT BROKE ATTEMPT 1. The obvious follow-up -- "the real `^Warhead_` inherit is dead,
its node is deleted locally, drop it" -- is WRONG. A `^Warhead_` template carries WEAPON-LEVEL
fields too (`ValidTargets`, `ReloadDelay`, `Range`, `TargetActorCenter`), and the shim carries
NONE. Dropping the inherit silently stripped `TargetActorCenter` off 60+ weapons and left three
warheads with an EMPTY TYPE (the boot-NRE class). A node-level deadness test cannot see either.

SO THE NEW TEMPLATE INHERITS THE TWIN, and takes over the removal the weapon used to do:

    ^Warhead_CannonHE_Heavy_Flat:
        Inherits: ^Warhead_CannonHE_Heavy    <- weapon-level fields arrive through the chain
        -Warhead@CannonHE_Heavy:             <- the twin's main; the flat node replaces it
        Warhead@CannonHE_Heavy_Flat: AreaDamage
            ...the shim's own body, verbatim

and each user loses the now-redundant direct inherit and the removal line the template performs:

    SomeWeapon:                              SomeWeapon:
        Inherits@wh: ^Warhead_CannonHE_Heavy     Inherits@wh: ^Warhead_CannonHE_Heavy_Flat
        Inherits: ^Compatibility_CannonHE_HeavyFlat
        -Warhead@CannonHE_Heavy:
        Warhead@CannonHE_HeavyFlatCompatibility: Warhead@CannonHE_Heavy_Flat:
            Damage: 40000                            Damage: 40000

Both deletions are MANDATORY, not tidying:
  * keeping the direct inherit puts `^Warhead_CannonHE_Heavy` on a single root-to-ancestor path
    TWICE (`MiniYaml.cs:463-476` threads `inherited` DOWN), which is the `Parent type X was
    already inherited` BOOT CRASH. Two sibling shims sharing one twin is a diamond and stays
    legal -- only the root-to-ancestor repeat crashes.
  * keeping the weapon's `-Warhead@<twin>` line orphans it, because the template already removed
    that key, and `There are no elements with key X to remove` is the OTHER boot crash. The
    Python resolver CANNOT see this class: it reported 0 changed weapons once on a tree that
    would not start. Only the engine finds it, which is why the boot gate is not optional.

HOW IT GATES ITSELF. Heuristics are what produced attempt 1, so this run does not trust any.
It applies, then compares the RESOLVED node of every weapon against a pristine baseline
worktree, order-insensitively and through the name map. Any template whose users move CONTENT
is excluded and the whole edit is redone from clean, until the surviving set verifies EXACTLY.
Whatever lands is provably behaviour-identical; whatever cannot is reported, not forced.

Usage:
    python tools/balance/promote_compatibility_warheads.py --base <pristine-worktree> [--apply]
