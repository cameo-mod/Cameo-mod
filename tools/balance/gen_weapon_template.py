"""gen_weapon_template.py — generate weapon-class template families.

THE TWO-LEVEL ORDERING LAW (maintainer 2026-08-01 — the most important part):
A weapon's Versus ORDER is built, never hand-typed, from two decisions:

  1. MACRO-TYPE PRIORITY — which unit TYPE it is strong against, best->worst:
     Infantry / Vehicle / Building / Aircraft. Types may be TIED (combined,
     interleaved) when a weapon is equally good vs several.
  2. LIGHT<->HEAVY DIRECTION — within every type, is it better vs LIGHT or
     HEAVY armor? Applied to the armor SUB-LADDERS (lightest -> heaviest):
        Infantry : None < Flak < Plate < Heroic
        Vehicle  : Scout < Light < Medium < Heavy < Superheavy
        Building : Wood < Steel < Concrete
        Aircraft : Fighter < Bomber < Helicopter < Spaceship
     anti-LIGHT weapons (HE, flame, bullets) hit None > ... > Heroic;
     anti-HEAVY weapons (AP, tesla, railgun) hit Heroic > ... > None.

The 16-armor order = concatenate the macro blocks in priority order; inside
each block list the sub-ladder in the chosen direction; interleave tied blocks
round-robin. Then LEVEL (Light/Medium/Heavy = step 6/5/4 = WC 0.75/1.0/1.25)
only changes the falloff slope — ONE order per weapon TYPE, shared by L/M/H.

Naming: UNIFIED `^Warhead_<Family>_<Level>` (family-first, underscore).

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Shield — a rock-paper-scissors axis, NOT a function of the profile's shape
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Maintainer 2026-08-16: "shields have their own armor type so they feel unique. Energy
# weapons deal more damage to shields than physical weapons but physical weapons deal more
# damage to vehicle armor than energy weapons."
#
# The OLD law was `Shield = top + floor`, written when every profile peaked at exactly 100,
# so it produced the ceiling + floor (110/125/140). W13 renormalised to median-100, "top"
# became a function of each family's SHARPNESS, and the rule silently started rewarding
# sharpness instead of anti-shield design — Melee read 200 while Tesla read 151. A sword
# out-damaged a Tesla coil against an energy shield.
#
# ⚠ MEASURED (see SHIELD_AND_NORMALISATION_PLAN.md §5b): NO structural formula can carry the
# identity. `floor` and `top` are ANTI-CORRELATED by construction — a normalised profile that
# is sharp necessarily has a low floor and a high top, and a flat one the reverse — so any
# product of them cancels out to an invariant of the normalisation rather than a property of
# the weapon (`200+floor` spans just 1.26x, the geometric mean 1.54x, both with >50% ties).
#
# So the structural term sets the SCALE and the physics rank sets the ORDER:
#
#     Shield = PHYSICS_RANK[family] x SHIELD_LEVEL[level] x sqrt((200+floor)(100+top)) x K
#
# K is calibrated so `Tesla_Super` lands on exactly 400 — the value Tesla carried before its
# anti-shield `ExtraDamage` chip was merged into the main warhead by the AreaDamage
# conversion, which is what deleted the identity's carrier in the first place.
#
# ⚠ Shield is exempt from the [10,200] window in BOTH directions now. It used to be "the one
# value always ABOVE the cap" because shields were assumed uniformly soft; under the ruling
# above they are soft to ENERGY and HARD to kinetics, so physical families land below 100
# (Melee 76 — a blade is the canonical thing a shield stops). The old invariant was a
# consequence of the old assumption, not a law in its own right.

# DAMPING the structural term (W25 S1, 2026-08-16)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# §5b promised the structural term would "anchor the band without fighting the physics rank
# for control of the ordering". Post-S1 that was MEASURABLY FALSE at the very top: the scale
# swings 1.198x across the set while `Tesla -> Storm` is only a 1.053x rank gap, so
# `Storm_Super` (rank 0.95) overtook `Tesla_Super` (1.00) — 425.3 against 420.5. It did the
# same at Heavy and Medium. That inverts the maintainer's anchor law ("the only thing that
# should deal extreme damage to shields is tesla") through a term that was only ever meant
# to set the band.
#
# So the term is DAMPED to the one job §5b actually left it: separating families whose
# physics rank is EQUAL (`ChemCannon`/`ChemMissile` both 0.50, `CannonHE`/`MissileHE` both
# 0.33). The exponent is derived, not chosen — it is exactly the largest damping under which
# the SMALLEST genuine rank gap still wins:
#
#     damp = ln(smallest distinct rank ratio) / ln(the scale term's own swing)
#
# Both inputs come from things that do not move when profiles do: `PHYSICS_RANK` is a design
# table, and the swing is bounded by the WINDOW — with the mean pinned at 100 the profile's
# floor cannot exceed 100 and its top cannot exceed 200, so
# `sqrt((200+floor)(100+top))` lives in `sqrt(210x200) .. sqrt(300x300)` = 204.9 .. 300.0.
# Using the window bound rather than the measured spread slightly OVER-damps, which is the
# safe direction: it can only make a real rank gap more decisive, never less.

# constants (`SHIELD_GEOMEAN`/`ALPHA`/`ANCHOR`) that this very step would have invalidated.
# They were correct for the pre-S1 profiles and silently wrong the moment those moved, which
# is a hazard no comment can fix; derived-every-run cannot go stale at all.
#
# The x100 is not cosmetic: after damping, two equal-rank families differ by ~1%, which at a

# `Armor@HAZMAT` (hazmat suits, Soviet reactive armor: 329 actors) and `Armor@REFLECTOR`
# (Allied reflective plating: 16 actors) — carried IN ADDITION to the actor's real armor.
#
# ⚠ **THE ARITHMETIC CHANGED UNDER W21 AND THE VALUES DID NOT.** When armor types
# MULTIPLIED, a row of 50 meant exactly "halve the incoming damage", independent of the
# target. They now AVERAGE, so the same 50 gives
#
#     effective = (base + 50) / 2   ->   at base 100, that is 75, a 25% cut, NOT 50%.
#
# **Averaging silently halved every overlay's effect.** And it caps the mechanic: with one
# overlay the best possible is `(base + 10) / 2`, i.e. ~45% — no row value can ever reach
# the old 50%, because that would need a row of 0, which is immunity.
#
# So the row is solved from the REDUCTION it should produce rather than written directly:
#
#     effective = (100 + x) / 2 = 100 - R x 100      ->      x = 100 - 200 R
#
# The reference base of 100 is not an assumption — W25 S1 pinned every family's Versus MEAN
# to exactly 100, so 100 IS the average armor row a weapon writes. That is the second thing
# S1 bought: overlay armors became solvable.
#
# With `OVERLAY_DEPTH = 0.45` (the ceiling above), `x = 100 - 90 x share`. A share of 1.0
# lands on the window floor of 10 and reproduces the old multiplicative feel as closely as
# averaging permits; a share of 0 OMITS the row.
#
# ⚠ **OMITTING IS NOT THE SAME AS WRITING 100.** Both the engine and Cameo's override filter
# on `Versus.ContainsKey(armorType)`, so an absent row drops the overlay OUT of the average
# entirely, while `100` pulls the result toward 100. Omission is the only way to say "this
# weapon does not care about the plating", and it is what a zero share must produce.

# THE FIVE ARMOR PLATINGS (maintainer, 2026-08-16)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# *"Hazmat against fire, chemical and radiation, BLAST against all the HE weapons,
#  reflector against energy, composite against AP weapons and bullets ... they are all good
#  against a certain family but bad against another and medium against everything else ...
#  also they will average on 100% each across all weapon types ... and we need to make sure
#  that every weapon family has an armor counter and every armor type has a weapon counter"*
#
# ⚠ **These get a row in EVERY template, exactly like `Shield`.** That is what makes LAYER
# SELECTION safe: the plating replaces the class armor while it is on, and a sparse row set
# would leave the armor list empty for the weapon classes it does not counter — which both
# the engine and `AreaDamageWarhead.DamageVersus` answer with 100, i.e. a superheavy tank
# taking full damage from bullets. Full columns, no gaps.
#
# ⚠ **A plating is a TRADE, not an upgrade.** Being WEAK against something is the design, so
# the "an upgrade must never increase damage" invariant does NOT apply to these the way it
# applied to the old additive overlays — it is superseded by the column law below. What makes
# that safe is selection: only one row is ever read, so a weak row is a chosen exposure
# rather than a penalty stacked on top of the class armor.
#
# THE COLUMN LAW: every plating's mean across all templates is the SAME, so no plating is
# stronger overall — they differ only in WHAT they are strong against. This is the transpose
# of W25 S1 (which pins each WEAPON's mean across armors) and the two cannot conflict:
# platings live in NON_ARMOR_ROWS, so they never entered S1's row mean, and S1's armors never
# enter this column mean.
#
# ⚠ **The common mean is 70, NOT 100, and the difference is a measured bug fix.** A plating
# REPLACES the class armor, so what matters is how its column compares to the one it
# displaces — and six of the sixteen class armors already average better than 100 (`Heroic`
# 74.3, the four aircraft 76-80). At a mean of 100 a hero or an aircraft that took a plating
# got 25-35% WORSE, and `td_gdi_upgrade_heavyaircraftarmorplating` is live. That is the same
# failure as the old averaging bug arriving by a different route: not stacking badly, but
# DISPLACING SOMETHING BETTER. 70 sits just under `Heroic`'s 74.3, so a plating is a genuine
# upgrade for every armor it can replace. The maintainer's law is untouched — its purpose was
# that platings be equal to EACH OTHER, which any common mean satisfies. The ~30% durability
# this grants must then be PRICED (see E1); it is not free, it is merely not yet charged for.
PLATING_TARGET_MEAN = 70.0
#
# NAMING: every plating is ALL CAPS (maintainer, 2026-08-16) — the class armors are
# TitleCase (`None`, `Superheavy`, `Concrete`), so the case alone tells a reader which LAYER
# a Versus row belongs to without having to remember the taxonomy. Each name is the most
# recognisable real term for its role rather than a coined one:
#
#   HAZMAT     the sealed / filtered suit — already an all-caps acronym in the real world
#   COMPOSITE  Chobham-type ceramic matrix, the standard word for modern armour
#   BLAST      names the threat, as HAZMAT does; `SPALL` (the liner) was the alternative and
#              is more precise but less legible — this is a one-word revert either way
#   REFLECTOR  the mirrored / ablative coating
#
# THE CYCLE: FOUR platings over the roster's four real damage axes, each countering one and
# weak to the next — `thermo -> kinetic -> blast -> energy -> thermo`. Every step is a defeat
# mechanism, not flavour:
#
#   HAZMAT     counters thermochemical  weak to KINETIC  a seal has no mass; a bullet passes
#                                                        through a rubber suit
#   COMPOSITE  counters kinetic+SHAPED  weak to BLAST    ceramic shatters a penetrator and ERA
#                                                        breaks a jet — a real tank carries
#                                                        both — but neither spreads an impulse
#   BLAST      counters blast           weak to ENERGY   a liner absorbs mechanical impulse,
#                                                        and a beam delivers none
#   REFLECTOR  counters energy          weak to THERMO   flame and corrosives foul the surface,
#                                                        and a dull mirror is just thin plate
#
# ⚠ **`Reactive` was cut on the measurement, not on taste** (§H2). Composition share across
# all 33 families: thermochemical 27.4%, kinetic 23.4%, blast 22.7%, energy 20.1% — and
# shaped charge **6.4%**, with only `MissileAP` shaped-led. It failed the maintainer's own
# niche test, the one that already retired `Insulated`, `Damping` and `Warding`. The `shaped`
# AXIS survives as an honest description of what those warheads are; it is simply counted
# under `COMPOSITE`, which is how a real tank is built anyway.
#
# A four-cycle is not degenerate: each plating is weak to what the NEXT one counters, so it is
# one 4-cycle rather than two mirrored 2-cycles. (An earlier note claimed only an ODD cycle
# could avoid that collapse — wrong; what matters is that no two platings counter each other's
# weakness.)

    # *"there should also be a generic ARMOR armor type called ARMOR that receives 100%

    #  StarCraft and Warcraft armor upgrades. So in a way this could be our fifth armor
    #  type."*
    #
    # It counters nothing and is weak to nothing, so `plating_raw` returns a FLAT 100 for
    # every family — "100% damage from everything", exactly as stated — and the column law
    # then scales that flat row to the common mean like any other plating. No special case
    # is needed anywhere: the empty tuples ARE the definition.
    #
    # It is the fifth plating the roster CAN support, and it sidesteps §H2 entirely: it is
    # not a fifth damage AXIS (which the measurement showed cannot be even) but a fifth
    # CHOICE with no axis at all. So the four-way partition stays exactly as even as it was.
    #
    # In play it is the HEDGE: identical average durability to the four specialists, but
    # flat, so it is never punished for guessing wrong. Against a known opponent a specialist
    # beats it; against an unknown one it does not. That is a real decision rather than a
    # filler option — and it is the honest home for every generic "+armor" upgrade

# ⚠ EVERY EMITTED FAMILY'S ROW MUST BE UNIQUE (maintainer, 2026-08-17: *"I want all weapon
# families to be a bit more unique so don't put 3 energy weapons exactly on the same versus

# boundary. The cycle reads `kinetic` and `shaped` as one SET, so five axes give exactly FOUR
# distinguishable groups — {thermo} / {kinetic+shaped} / {blast} / {energy} — and refining
# WITHIN one group is arithmetically INERT: `Bullet` 0.90/0.10 against `Arrow` 0.65/0.35 was
# measured as BYTE-IDENTICAL. So every secondary share below names a SECOND real defeat
# mechanism; none is a fudge to break a tie, because a fabricated difference is a lie about the
# model (`b182fd228`). `tools/tests/test_plating_composition.py` pins the uniqueness, and

# W25 S1 — THE MEAN-100 LAW (maintainer, 2026-08-16)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# *"all warheads average all versus values at 100 to make them comparable"*
#
# W13 normalised each profile to its MEDIAN. That left every family's MEAN free, and
# a family's mean is not a shape statistic — it is a MAGNITUDE. `K` is a share-weighted
# average of the profile, so the mean IS the family's contribution to priced DPS, and
# picking a family silently changed a weapon's total output as well as its shape.
# Measured across the 94 shipped templates before this change: means ran 22.0
# (`Magic_Light`) to 106.1 (`MissileAA_Light`), averaging 75.0 — i.e. up to a 4.8x
# hidden multiplier between two families that both looked "normalised".
#
# Pinning the mean at 100 makes:
#   * `K` SHAPE-ONLY — choosing a family redistributes output across armors without
#     changing how much of it there is;
#   * `Damage` the sole magnitude knob, which is what the balance pipeline wants;
#   * families directly comparable, which is the maintainer's stated goal.
#
# The mean is UNWEIGHTED over the 16 armor rows, deliberately. A share-weighted mean
# would be a better predictor of realised DPS, but it would make a profile's legality
# depend on the current unit roster — every roster change would silently move every
# template. Uniform weighting is a property of the profile alone.
#
# ⚠ **The window makes this a constraint, not just a rescale.** With the mean pinned at
# 100, `max <= 200` becomes `max <= 2 x mean`: a profile that is brilliant against three
# armors and useless against thirteen CANNOT keep its peak, because thirteen low values
# drag the mean down. Measured: 11 of 94 templates breach the ceiling under a plain
# rescale, worst `Melee_Medium` at 316 (median 35.5 against a peak of 174 — the extreme
# bottom-heavy profile). Those 11 are brought back by the POWER LAW about the geometric
# mean, `v' = G x (v/G) ** alpha`, never by clamping. Three reasons it is the right
# instrument, the third specific to this step:
#
#   1. it is monotone, so the ordering law's sequence survives untouched;
#   2. it preserves the geometric mean, the correct centre for a set of MULTIPLIERS;
#   3. **it preserves the derived-armor relation exactly.** §12.0b sets
#      `Heroic = Plate x Scout / peak`, and the power law satisfies
#      `G(P/G)^a x G(S/G)^a / G(peak/G)^a == G(H/G)^a` identically — so Heroic stays
#      derived without being recomputed. A clamp or an affine squeeze breaks that.
#
# The cost is real and is reported by `report_versus_change.py`: the 11 compressed
# templates lose sharpness (Melee 6.69x -> 2.86x, Arrow 4.71x -> 3.01x; the other eight
# move by less than 1.0x). Median spread across all 94 barely moves, 3.06x -> 3.00x, so
# the field band (2/4/8) still holds. If the maintainer wants Melee's skew back, the
# lever is the CEILING, not this function — under mean-100 a peak of 2x the average is
# arithmetic, not policy.
#
# ⚠ **Scope: the MAIN warhead only.** The `_Percentage` twin encodes its magnitude IN
# its Versus rows (`Damage` is a fixed 1-per-2000 grid), so normalising it would multiply
# every %-effect by ~5x. Rebasing the twins is W18's atomic job.

# W25 S2 — THE CLASS TILT (maintainer, 2026-08-16)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# *"light weapons have a bigger damage to light armor types while heavy weapons have a
#  bigger damage to heavy armor types with medium weapons having bigger damage to medium
#  armor types ... all inside their own family (compared for example light, medium and
#  heavy flame weapons) ... and super just deals a more flat damage to everything so it's
#  overall good (but still doesn't have the same values, just a more flat curve)"*
#
# With the mean pinned at 100 by S1, a tilt is FREE: it costs nothing in total output, it
# only moves where the output lands. That is what makes this expressible at all.
#
# The maintainer wrote the tilt as three armor SETS (SHIELD_AND_NORMALISATION_PLAN §6c):
#
#     Light  -> None · Wood · Scout · Light · Fighter
#     Medium -> Flak · Steel · Medium · Bomber · Helicopter
#     Heavy  -> Plate · Concrete · Heavy · Superheavy · Spaceship
#
# Implemented as ladder POSITION rather than as a hard-coded set, because position is what
# those sets ARE: the lightest rung of every ladder, the middle rung of every ladder, the
# heaviest rung of every ladder. Reading them off `LADDERS` reproduces all three sets
# exactly and keeps working if a ladder ever gains a rung, where a literal set would
# silently leave the new armor untilted.
#
# ⚠ **THE TILT MUST NEVER REORDER A LADDER.** The two-level ordering law (maintainer
# 2026-08-01, "the most important part") fixes which armor in a ladder takes the biggest
# value, and a Heavy-level tilt on an anti-LIGHT family pushes exactly the wrong way — left
# alone it would invert `None > Flak > Plate` and make a rifle best against plate. So the
# tilt is applied to the VALUES, and then each armor is given back the RANK it held before:
#
#   * where the tilt agrees with the family's direction it SHARPENS the ladder;
#   * where it disagrees it FLATTENS it;
#   * it can never invert it, and it needs no `direction` argument — the profile's own
#     order is the authority, which is what makes this work for the blends too (they have
#     no `build_order` at all, their shape comes from averaging their parents).
#
# The relative statement the maintainer asked for survives intact: `Scout` takes a larger
# share of Flame_Light's output than of Flame_Heavy's, and `Superheavy` the reverse.
#
# `TILT_RATIO` is the weight span across a ladder, so 1.5 means the favoured end is pulled
# 1.5x harder than the disfavoured end BEFORE renormalisation. Chosen to stay inside the
# measured field band (2/4/8) after the sharpening it causes — see the audit below.
TILT_RATIO = 1.5

    # The drain rate is `(1 if the damage carries the `Tesla` type else 0) + IntegrityScale/100`
    # per point of damage, against a pool of 100% of max HP. Waveforce is the one integrity
    # family that never received `Tesla` in its DamageTypes, so it lost the 1:1 passive drain and
    # kept only its 20% scale — needing **5x the target's max HP** to reach the disable. The
    # target dies five times over first. Measured, not inferred (PSEUDO_ARMOR_AND_INTEGRITY §B).
    #
    # Maintainer: *"waveforce should remove the integrity damage entirely because it can never
    # actually reach a full integrity damage, so that it is not calculated in the balance formula
    # without any effect."* Exactly right, and the second half is the important half: a knob that
    # does nothing in play but is still read by the pricing model is worse than no knob at all,
    # because the weapon is charged for an effect it cannot deliver.
    #
    # The alternative — granting Waveforce the `Tesla` damage type — was NOT taken: that would
    # give a 3/5-kinetic blend the same EMP status as a Tesla coil, which is a design claim
    # nobody made. If Waveforce should have an EMP role it needs both halves, deliberately.
