    python tools/balance/bot_insurance_model.py            # behaviour table, all difficulties
    python tools/balance/bot_insurance_model.py --trace medium

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS. `DynamicBotInsurance.cs` cannot be compiled, run or boot-gated from a cloud
container (no `engine/`, no dotnet — CLAUDE.md rule 7). The C# is therefore unverified *as code*.
But the part that is actually easy to get wrong is not the C# — it is the STATE MACHINE: a
threshold that falls, freezes, and re-arms, with a delay derived from a rolling average, has
several ways to oscillate, stick, or never fire. That much can be verified here, exactly, and it
is what `tools/tests/test_bot_insurance_model.py` asserts.

⚠ THIS FILE AND THE C# MUST BE CHANGED TOGETHER. It is a reference model, not documentation:
if they drift, the tests are testing a fiction. Keep `tick()` a line-for-line mirror of
`DynamicBotInsurance.ITick.Tick`.

THE MACHINE, in three phases:

  ARMING    the bar TRACKS the rolling average of total spendable funds, moving toward
             clamp(average, MinThreshold,
            MaxThreshold) by at most `rate_per_tick` a tick -- up when the average is above it,
             down when below, at the same rate either way. When the bar reaches the owner's liquid
             funds (`liquidity < threshold`) the owner qualifies -> freeze, compute the delay, go to
             DELAYING.

            ⛔ IT IS A SLEW-LIMITED TRACKER, NOT A ONE-WAY RAMP, AND NOT A FALLING BAR. Two
            earlier designs were tried and rejected against this model:
              * FALLING from MaxThreshold (the original spec) is DEAD MECHANICS. The trigger
                `liquidity < threshold` is easiest to satisfy when the bar is HIGHEST, so a falling bar
                fires on tick one for anyone under MaxThreshold and only ever makes triggering
                harder afterwards. Measured, every difficulty behaved identically and the whole
                ordering came from the delay divisor -- the rate did nothing at all.
              * RISING ONCE from zero works, but the bar never comes back down, so it stops
                describing the economy the moment the economy changes.
            Tracking in both directions keeps the rate meaningful (`cameogod` converges ten times
            faster than `easiest`) AND keeps the bar an honest smoothed picture of how the owner
            has actually been doing.
  DELAYING  wait `average / delay_divisor` ticks, clamped. Recovering above the frozen bar cancels
            outright and re-arms from the top.
  PAYING    grant a payout SCALED BY DEPTH until total spendable funds reach MaxThreshold, then
             re-arm. Resource-purifier deliveries bank only during this phase and every payout is
             capped at the remaining gap.

⭐ THE PAYOUT IS PROPORTIONAL TO DEPTH, WHICH IS WHERE THE OLD LADDER'S GRANULARITY CAME FROM.
The ten-rung ladder was not merely ten difficulties — the rungs STACKED, so a `cameogod` bot drew
1 credit/tick just under 10000 and 10 credits/tick near zero. A flat "on/off" payout throws that
away and makes the hardest bot draw its maximum the whole time it is insured. So:

    depth_permille = clamp(1000 * (MaxThreshold - liquidity) / MaxThreshold, 0, 1000)
    accumulator   += cash_per_tick * depth_permille
    grant          = accumulator // 1000        # and keep the remainder

Measured against the old ladder for `cameogod`: cash 9000 -> 1/tick (old: 1 rung), 5000 -> 5/tick
(old: 5 rungs), 0 -> 10/tick (old: 10 rungs). It REPRODUCES the ladder and then keeps going
between the rungs, which is the "more granular than before" the maintainer asked for.

⚠ Integer milli-credit accumulation, not floating point: the payout must be deterministic across
machines or it desyncs. The remainder carries, so a 0.5 credit/tick rate really pays 1 credit every
other tick rather than rounding to nothing — which is what a naive integer divide would do to every
low difficulty.

⚠ THE EXIT IS `MaxThreshold`, NOT THE FROZEN BAR. Leaving at the bar it entered on re-triggers
within a few ticks, forever — a payout oscillator. `test_paying_does_not_oscillate` pins that.

Everything scales by the owner's INDEX in the difficulty list, so a new difficulty is one more
name and no new traits or conditions — which is the whole point of replacing the ten-rung ladder.
