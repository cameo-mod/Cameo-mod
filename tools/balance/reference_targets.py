"""reference_targets.py — the R4 synthesis for real actors: 3 references + Cameo, one vote each.

PRIOR ART, and why this is not a fourth copy of it:
  * `assign_references.py` chooses WHICH reference units a Cameo actor may use. It stops at the
    pairing and stores only the reference's name/hp/cost.
  * `reference_distribution.py` owns the coordinate machinery (`aggregates`, `coordinates`,
    `project`, `gm`) and builds every source's own distributions. All of it is imported here.
  * `explain_unit.py` shows ONE actor's working, and re-matches with the superseded prefix test
    rather than reading the assignment.
This module is the missing join: the ASSIGNMENT's pairs, run through the DISTRIBUTION's
coordinates, for a whole faction at a time.

⛔ R4 — EQUAL THIRDS, AND CAMEO ALWAYS VOTES (maintainer, `REFERENCE_EXTRACTION_PLAN.md`):
   `Cameo TD GDI = DTA GDI x Combined Arms GDI x current Cameo TD GDI`, each 1/3, geometric mean.
   Generalised: every voice is equal, so with 3 references Cameo is 1 of 4 = 25%.

⛔ RAW STATS ARE NEVER AVERAGED ACROSS SOURCES. DTA runs ~2,500 HP vehicles and Combined Arms
~30,000; their mean belongs to no game. Only the DIMENSIONLESS coordinates are pooled, then
projected onto Cameo's own distribution. See `REFERENCE_METHOD.md` §1-§2.

# ⛔ DISCRETE COUNTS ARE TAKEN DIRECTLY, NEVER PROJECTED (maintainer caught this 2026-09-12:
# "the mammoth tank always has 2 bursts for all weapons from all sources right? and you
# averaged it to 1.67x?" -- correct, and the projection was the culprit, not an average).
#
# `target_for`'s normal path converts a raw value into its POSITION within that source's own
# distribution and maps the position onto Cameo's. That is right for HP, speed, cost, range
# and DPS: continuous magnitudes spanning orders of magnitude, where "this unit is a heavy in
# its own game" is the transferable fact and the raw number is not.
#
# It is WRONG for `w_burst`. Burst is a small integer the engine can only take whole, the
# distributions have wildly different supports, and they are dominated by outliers that have
# nothing to do with the unit in hand:
#
#     DTA Enhanced        burst min 2  max   4
#     OpenRA Tiberian Dawn          1        5
#     Combined Arms                 1       30
#     Cameo (projected onto)        1      100
#
# So a Mammoth's 2 -- low inside a 1..30 support -- maps low into a 1..100 support and lands
# at 1.67, even though EVERY eligible source says exactly 2. (The three `HTNK.*` Combined Arms
# variants that say 1 or 2 are `reference_base_eligible: False` upgraded variants and never
# voted at all.)
#
# MEASURED over the 209 actors that have both a burst and a burst target: 163 have UNANIMOUS
# agreement among their eligible sources, and projection contradicts that unanimous value on a
# large share of them -- `cabal_plasmaturret` every source 5, projected 2.21; `forgotten_mlrs`
# every source 8, projected 5.08; `cabal_cyborginfantry` every source 3, projected 1.92.
#
# Direct pooling reports a CHANGE on 98 of 209 against projection's 77, and that is the point:
# the extra ones are real disagreements between Cameo and its sources, which is exactly what
# the maintainer asked to see flagged in the map. `Burst` may not be touched without explicit
# permission, so the number has to be the sources' actual burst, not a position-derived one.
#
# One vote per source (median across that source's eligible rows), then the median of the
# source votes -- median, not mean, because the answer must be a count and an even split
# between 2 and 4 should read as one of them, not as 3.
DIRECT_STATS = ("w_burst",)

# ⛔ LAW-GOVERNED STATS TAKE NO REFERENCE TARGET AT ALL.
# `turn_speed` and `turn_ratio` are not free parameters in Cameo — DESIGN.md fixes them:
# `TurnSpeed = Speed / 5` for turreted units, `2 x Speed / 5` for turretless/frontal ones,
# DERIVED IN C# and not written in yaml (maintainer 2026-09-07), with a turret always matching
# its hull and `audit_turn_speed.py` T3 guarding it. Cameo's `turn_ratio` is therefore 5.0 or
# 2.5 BY LAW, and asking the peers what it should be is asking a question Cameo has already
# answered — a reference target here can only contradict a shipped ruling.
#
# And the projection made that contradiction loud, because `turn_ratio` is DIMENSIONLESS
# (speed / turn_speed), so the peers' raw values are directly comparable and projecting a
# position in a distribution is meaningless. Measured 2026-09-12 on actors whose sources all
# agree:
#     asianalliance_howitzer      all sources 1.00   projected 3.83
#     asianalliance_pulverizer    all sources 0.60   projected 3.51
#     asianalliance_harbinger     all sources 4.67   projected 11.55
# An 11.55 turn ratio is not a number any mod authored; it is an artifact.
#
# ⚠ Two different repairs, and the distinction matters. `w_burst` is scale-free AND a real
# design input, so it moved to DIRECT_STATS and still produces a target. `turn_*` is scale-free
# and NOT an input, so it produces none. Do not "fix" these by adding them to DIRECT_STATS.
#
# Verified safe: nothing consumes a turn target. `build_reference_report` shows hp/speed/range/
# dps/burst/cost, `build_japan_pilot.AXES` is hp/speed/w_range/cost, and `apply_balance` writes
# `turn_speed` from the LEDGER (where the derived law put it), never from a reference.

    maintainer stated on 2026-09-13: *"if burst delays vary between bursts then you need to simply
    add all the burst delays up together with the reload delay"*. I briefly shipped a second copy
    here — including a duplicate `ENGINE_DEFAULT_BURST_DELAY` — which is the `allows()` mistake
    this repo has already paid for twice: two implementations agree until one of them is fixed.

    rule, with the single entry as its shorthand, and `WeaponInfo.cs:129` supplies `[5]` to the
    36 Cameo weapons with `Burst > 1` that declare none.

    ⚠ ONE DIFFERENCE, AND IT IS UNREACHABLE TODAY. On an ILLEGAL array length `formula` returns

    damage per tick and not damage per second so the term is misleading"*). Every term in the
    divisor — `ReloadDelay`, `BurstDelays` — is authored in engine ticks, so the quotient is
    per tick and converting to seconds needs the tick rate, which is a separate question and
    varies with game speed. The stored FIELD is still called `w_dps` across the ledgers and
    corpora and renaming it is a migration of its own; this function, and every label it feeds,
    say "per tick" so the misnomer stops spreading.

    reference for checking! ... and that same formula should be used everywhere so yeah please
    use that one formula for all the DPS calculation"*.

    It is the engine's own cycle, and both extractors already agreed with it — they simply said
    it differently. `extract_peer_units` computes `damage_pos * burst / (reload + burst_time)`,
    which is this verbatim. The Cameo snapshot computes `w_damage / cycle` with no burst factor,
    which is the SAME NUMBER only because its `w_damage` is already the burst total. Feeding this
