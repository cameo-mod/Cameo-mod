"""carrier_slave_ammo.py — the ammo-pool sizing law for carrier slaves (DESIGN §11b.0 R8).

MAINTAINER RULING R8, quoted because the arithmetic is theirs:

  "ammo pool should be made so that firing all weapons on the target in a single burst attack
   will empty the ammo completely. For example the carrier slave has a machinegun that fires a
   burst of 10 then the carrier slave should also have ammo of 10 and deplete with one attack
   round completely and reloading from empty to full should always take 100 ticks so in this
   case reloading 1 ammo every 10 ticks. If the unit has more than one weapons you need to make
   the ammo pool and the ammo consumption per weapon so that both consume the ammo pool equally
   fast. For example if the previous slave now has an additional dual rocket they would consume
   each 5 ammo per shot so both the machine gun and the rockets would use the 10 ammo so the
   ammo pool would need to be at 20 and the ammo reload would be 1 ammo per 5 ticks instead so
   at 100 ticks it's full again"

THE LAW, and it reproduces both of those worked examples exactly (see `_self_test`):

    share    = lcm(Burst_i) over the SCORING armaments
    usage_i  = share / Burst_i          -- so every armament spends `share` per full burst
    Ammo     = N x share                -- N = the largest mutually-engageable group
    Count    = Ammo / gcd(Ammo, 100)    -- empty to full in exactly 100 ticks
    Delay    = 100  / gcd(Ammo, 100)

`Count`/`Delay` is reduced by the gcd rather than written as `Delay = 100/Ammo`, because that
division is only exact when Ammo divides 100. Ammo 16 needs `Count 4 / Delay 25`, not a
truncated delay of 6 that would refill in 96 ticks.

WHICH ARMAMENTS SCORE. Three cases, and only the first is in the ruling as written:

  * UNCONDITIONAL -> scores.
  * ADDITIVE UPGRADE (`RequiresCondition: X` with no sibling requiring `!X`) -> `AmmoUsage: 0`,
    per the ruling: "if they get an extra weapon from an upgrade then that new weapon needs to
    have ammo usage of 0 so that it will not interfere with the ammo system".
  * REPLACEMENT PAIR (`X` and `!X` on siblings) -> ONE slot, not two. Both sides get the SAME
    usage and the slot is counted ONCE. ⚠ Treating the `X` side as an additive upgrade and
    zeroing it — which the ruling's wording invites — would leave `japan_zerofighter_slave`
    consuming NO ammo at all once its waveforce upgrade is bought, because both of its live
    armaments are on the `X` side.

N IS NOT SIMPLY THE ARMAMENT COUNT. `A10Carrier` carries `Armament@AA` (`ValidTargets: Air`)
and `Armament@BOMBS` (`Ground, Water`); they can never fire at the same target, so counting
them as concurrent would inflate the pool and the unit could never empty it in one attack.
N is therefore the size of the largest group of scoring armaments that share a target class.
An AA-only engagement then drains only the AA share, which is correct — nothing else fired.

⚠ SUICIDE SLAVES ARE OUT OF SCOPE and the maintainer's two names are not the whole set. They
named `tkmsuicidedrone` and `farasha_drone_ixian`, whose self-destruct is in the WEAPON (its
name is the actor's own, or `*Explosion`) and shows up in no trait. Three more qualify under
the same rule via `SpawnedExplodes` or a self-destruct weapon: `SCSCOURGEDRONE`, `kami.asian`,
`tsprobe`. A reload trait on a unit that dies when it attacks is dead weight, so all five are
skipped and named in the report. Scope is **14 actors, not the 17** that 19-minus-2 implied.
