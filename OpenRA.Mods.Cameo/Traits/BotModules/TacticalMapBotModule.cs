 * Ported from the Crystallized Nexus CNTacticalMapBotModule (crystallized-nexus
 * commit 30cf70a, GPLv3, Copyright (c) The Crystallized Nexus Developers).
 *
 * ZG-a scope: STATIC TOPOLOGY — passability snapshot, chokepoints
 * (passages / cliff ramps / bridges), the region cut gated by them, the
 * cell -> region-id lookup, and the shared Generation counter bumped on
 * bridge re-cuts.
 *
 * ZG-b scope: the per-bot BELIEF on top — the incremental 'useful'
 * chokepoint / sealable-corridor / high-ground refresh cadences, the
 * territory claiming race, door detection, and the region-ownership tally.
 * The donor ran all of this OMNISCIENT (live world.Actors scans); here every
 * enemy input comes from BotFogMemory via the master AI's situation
 * (Situation.Remembered), so a never-scouted enemy contributes nothing.
 * Because each bot sees differently, ownership/territory/doors are PER-BOT
 * state on this module — the donor parked RegionOwners on the shared
 * topology, which only works when every bot computes the identical answer.
 *
 * ZG-c scope: NearestRegionId (a gate/barrier cell's nearest region) moved onto
 * IBotZoneTopology so RegionMemory's zone backing can fold unzoned cells into a
 * region's memory instead of dropping them.
 *
 * Adaptations: CNChokepoint/CNRegion/CNSealableCorridor -> ZoneChokepoint/Zone/
 * ZoneGateCorridor (see IBotZoneTopology.cs); MaxDoorWidth -> MaxGateWidth
 * (its only ZG-a use is bounding the corridor the region cut resolves to);
 * CNBotLog -> CAAIUtils.BotDebug; the CNDestroyableCliff bridge-watch is
 * dropped — Cameo has no destroyable-cliff trait, so only bridge cells are
 * watched for passability changes. No CN engine patches required: the Cameo
 * engine already exposes PathFinder.GetOverlayDataForLocomotor returning the
 * same (abstract graph, abstract domains) pair the donor consumes.
