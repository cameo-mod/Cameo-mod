	// CN2 (AI_MASTER_PLAN §3, crystallized-nexus 30cf70a): port of CNRepairManagerBotModule. Sends damaged idle
	// base units to allied repair facilities - a depot (Repairable), a repair-near building (RepairableNear), or
	// within aura range of a mobile repairer (MobileRepairActorTypes). Building repair is owned by
	// BaseRepairBotModule (§19.3); this module only ever orders units.
	//
	// Cameo changes vs the donor:
	//  - Unit ownership is the §19.6 lease contract, not the CN squad manager: a unit ordered to a facility is
	//    claimed for the trip (BotLeasePurpose.Repair) so nothing re-drafts it mid-walk; claims renew every scan
	//    and release when the unit is healed, dead or gone. Without a registry (classic) nothing is claimed and
	//    every unit behaves as the donor's did.
	//  - The RepairableInBarracks path is dropped: that trait is CN-only and no Cameo pack declares it. If a pack
	//    wants barracks healing, vendor the trait and restore the path.
	//  - Candidates iterate in ActorID order (the donor's HashSet order is not a contract).
	//  - CNBotPerf instrumentation dropped.
