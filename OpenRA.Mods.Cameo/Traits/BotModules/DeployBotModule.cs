	// driving for units carrying GrantConditionOnDeploy - artillery sets up in range and packs away when the
	// enemy closes inside its dead zone, stat-deployers entrench when idle and threatened, support deploys near
	// enough allies, ability deploys fire once and pack back up.
	//
	// Cameo changes vs the donor:
	//  - §19.6: units another module holds (a Squad claim, an engineer job) are left alone entirely - a deploy
	//    order from this module would be refused by the order gate anyway, and claiming is wrong here because
	//    the unit's job belongs to its squad; deploy is a state toggle on top of it. Deploy decisions on
	//    squad-held artillery are the open contract question - tracked for the INC-n spec, not hacked around.
	//  - The donor's Support-mode threat scan had no visibility gate; enemy reads here all go through
	//    shroud.IsVisible (own units and allies need none).
	//  - Candidates iterate in ActorID order; CNBotPerf instrumentation dropped.
	//  - Namespace and config shape follow this assembly, not the donor's.
