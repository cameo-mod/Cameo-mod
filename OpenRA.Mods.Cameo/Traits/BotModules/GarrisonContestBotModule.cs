	// GC-1 (AI_ARCHITECTURE §12.19): the garrison contest. The A/B finding was that genericbot never fought for
	// neutral garrisonables - LoadGarrisonerBotModuleCA only drafts units that are IsIdle *and* unsquad-owned,
	// and on the new stack squads absorb every infantryman first, so the civilian bunkers went to the classic
	// bot by default and then shot the assaults apart. This module is the genericbot answer, in two passes:
	//
	//  - Contest: lease a small infantry contingent (BotLeasePurpose.Garrison, the §19.6 contract, so squads
	//    cannot re-draft the walkers mid-trip) and send it into the best reachable neutral garrisonable in the
	//    explored frontier - capacity-weighted nearest-first, early enough to beat the enemy to it. Targets are
	//    gated on Shroud.IsExplored, so the bot only claims what it has actually scouted.
	//  - Clear: enemy-occupied garrisonables (enemy-owned via ChangeOwnerOnGarrisoner, or remembered as
	//    garrisonable defences through IBotRememberedDefenceProvider - both fog-honest) are published as Raid
	//    missions on the IBotMissionProvider seam. Squads stay the execution authority: the assault goes through
	//    SiegeEvaluator's stand-off / artillery-first verdicts, so a garrison is bombarded down before infantry
	//    are committed instead of fed in one by one. Mission Id `raid:garrison_<cell>:r<zone>` keeps the
	//    attempt lineage per building.
	//
	// Denial is emergent: an enemy engineer/infantry column walking at a garrison we want produces the same
	// contest claim; once the building flips enemy it becomes a published Raid target, so it does not stay
	// enemy property for free.
	//
	// Owns its slice alone per the one-owner rule: when this module is armed, `LoadGarrisonerBotModuleCA@Infantry`
	// is disarmed for genericbot in ai.yaml (the classic stack keeps it untouched), exactly like
	// EngineerBotModule yields RepairBridge to BridgeRepairBotModule under cn3_bridge_repair.
