	// Merged from CA CaptureManagerBotModuleCA (Cameo's copy of CAmod's, itself from OpenRA.Mods.AS) and AS
	// CncEngineerManagerBotModule (engine d5d8b2a685) under DESIGN §19.3 (one module per decision). AI_MASTER_PLAN ENG.
	//   from CA: capture — a priority target by chance (nearest to the base first), otherwise the most valuable
	//            capturable of a random enemy/neutral player, nearest per engineer; SafePath was meant to route the
	//            engineer around enemy fire but never did (its goal predicate matched the start cell and the path was
	//            discarded) — SafeRoute below does it for real when MaxExposedRouteCells >= 0.
	//   from AS: bridge-hut repair and instant building repair (nearest path-reachable target, one engineer per
	//            evaluation, the repair jobs taking turns); the stuck check (moving, not moved since the last sample).
	//            DESIGN §19.5 lets the whole module see through fog (maintainer 2026-09-30); both visibility switches
	//            remain, so a fog-honest engineer owner is one yaml line each.
	//   new:     the ONE owner of every engineer (review P0b, "IsIdle is not ownership"): an LC1 claim before every
	//            order, renewed while the engineer works and released when it is idle again; its own in-flight set,
	//            so the capture and repair passes never order one engineer twice in a tick (the lease lets the same
	//            owner re-claim, so it cannot catch that); a stuck engineer is stopped, released and retried after
	//            StuckRetryTicks (the AS module benched it for the rest of the match); an optional visibility check
	//            for bridge huts (the AS module had none).
