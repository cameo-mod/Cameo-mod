	// CN2 (AI_MASTER_PLAN §3, crystallized-nexus 30cf70a): port of CNGarrisonBotModule. Sends spare idle infantry
	// into own buildings listed in GarrisonableBuildingTypes, preferring the specialist the local threat calls
	// for (anti-armour vs anti-air), and unloads a mismatched garrison once the threat flips and a free
	// specialist exists.
	//
	// Cameo changes vs the donor:
	//  - Cameo has no BotCapabilities trait (the same finding as CombatAnalysisBotModule): capability tags become
	//    yaml type sets (GarrisonableBuildingTypes / AntiArmorInfantryTypes / AntiAirInfantryTypes /
	//    EnemyArmorTypes) and AircraftInfo for air, per the explicit-list convention.
	//  - Targets the AS garrison pair (Garrisonable buildings + EnterGarrison orders + Garrisoner infantry),
	//    which is what Cameo packs deploy - the donor's Cargo/EnterTransport buildings exist here only as the
	//    owned-conditional tech-building variant.
	//  - `squadManager.IsUnitAssignedToSquad` and the public TryReserveInfantry callback are replaced by the
	//    §19.6 lease contract: the module claims each infantryman for the walk (BotLeasePurpose.Garrison) so
	//    squads and other owners skip it, renews every scan and releases on arrival, death or loss. Without a
	//    registry (classic) nothing is claimed - donor behaviour.
	//  - Threat assessment keeps the donor's fog check: only `CanBeViewedByPlayer` enemies count.
	//  - Candidates iterate in ActorID order; CNBotPerf/CNBotLog instrumentation dropped.
